I JUST RETURNED FROM HOUSTON, AND I AM EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT THE HOMEWORK THAT I DID NOT GET FINISHED BECAUSE OF WORK.  I AM SO BURNT OUT FROM WORK RIGHT NOW THAT THE TIME I HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK I ONLY FEEL LIKE SLEEPING.I AM SO NERVOUS ABOUT DOING WELL IN SCHOOL THAT I THINK I AM GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE MY JOB.  IT IS SUCH A HASTLE TO DRIVE BACK AND FORTH TO HOUSTON ON THE WEEKENDS THAT I DON'T THINK ITS WORTH IT.  ON THE OTHER HAND MY BOYFRIEND ALSO DRIVES IB SO AT LEAST I GET TO SEE HIM ON THE WEEKENDS.  IT IS HARD NOT HAVING HIM HERE SINCE HE GOES TO SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY.  I WISH HE COULD COME HERE. ALTHOUH I MISS ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT GO TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES I LOVE BEING HERE IN AUSTIN. I FEEL LIKE I'M MORE INDEPENDENT HERE.  WHEN I GO TO HOUSTON MY PARENTS TREAT ME LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID AND BAD STUFF MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME IF I STAY OUT PAST TWELVE, BUT HERE THERE IS NO ONE TELLING ME WHAT TIME TO COME HOME OR QUESTIONING ME ON WHO I HANG OUT WITH.  MY BOYFRIEND GETS MAD WHEN I TELL HIM HOW INDEPENDENT I AM BECOMING BECAUSE HE THINKS I DON'T NEED HIM ANYMORE. THATS NOT TRUE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HIM TO LIFT ME UP WHEN I FEEL THAT I CANT HANDLE THINGS OR TO CHEER ME UP[ WHEN I AM HAVING A BAD DAY.  I GUESS NO MATTER OW INDEPENDENT I BECOME IN SOME LITTLE WAY I'LL ALWAYS BE DEPENDENT ON HIM AND MY FAMILY.  ITS SO EXCITING NOT BEING IN HIGHSCHOOL ANYMORE AND BECOMING AN ADULT.  I LOVE THE THOUGHT THAT IN THE NOT SO FAR FUTURE I WILL HAVE A FAMILY OF MY OWN AND I GET TO TEACH MY KIDS EVERYTHING I KNOW.  EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO HAVE A CAREER BEFORE I HAVE CHILDREN I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I DO GET MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN. I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW AND I AM GLAD THAT I DIDN'T  DECIDE TO GO TO ANOTHER COLLEGE. THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES HERE, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BUCKLE DOWN AND STUDY.  BEFORE I CAME TO COLLEGE MY DAD TOLD ME THAT FOR EVERY HOUR YOUR IN CLASS TO STUDY THREE HOURS OUTSIDE OF CLASS.  I'M LEARNING THE HARD WAY THAT HE WAS RIGHT.   MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LISTEN TO HIM FROM NOW ON INSTEAD OF ALWAYS TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH DOING THE MINIMUM OF WHAT IS EXPECTED.  FROM TODAY ON THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO.  I REALLY MISS MY FAMILY, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SAYING THAT!!
