<b>New <a href=#download>version 1.03</a> available (24/06/2008) - <a href=#updates>what's new</a></b>

<p>

The Personality Recognizer is a Java command-line application that reads a set of text files and computes estimates of personality scores along the Big Five dimensions (Norman, 1963):

<ul>
<li>Extraversion 
<li>Emotional stability 
<li>Agreeableness
<li>Conscientiousness
<li>Openness to experience
</ul>

The program is based on models analyzed in (<a href=#ref>Mairesse et al., 2007</a>) that were shown to predict personality scores significantly better than a constant baseline. The program uses a command line interface, and outputs scores on a scale from 1 to 7, e.g. where 7 is strongly extravert. An <a href=demo.html>online web demo</a> is available.

<p>
First check that the required components are correctly installed:

<ul>
<li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 or later
<li><a href=http://www.mairesse.co.uk/personality/weka-3-4-3.tar.gz>Weka 3.4.3</a>

</ul>

<br><p>
<a name=updates></a><b><font face=Arial>History</font></b>
<p>
Major updates in version 1.03 (24/06/2008):
<ul>
<li> Added the -a option to write the existing feature values to a Weka <code>arff</code>
  file. This facilitates training models on new data, as well as the addition
  of new features. See <a href=#addFeat>details</a>.
</ul>
Major updates in version 1.02 (06/06/2007):
<ul>
<li> Added a <b>corpus analysis mode</b> (option -d) in which the recognizer estimates the personality of 
individual text files in a collection of texts by standardizing the feature values over the corpus 
and running standardized models that can be applied across domains.
<li> Removed 18 LIWC features that didn't generalize well across domain, e.g. School, Job, etc.
<li> Added models of <b>self-assessed personality</b> from written language, while previous models only estimated 
observed personality from spoken language (option -t).
<li> Added <b>SVM models</b> as a default (support vector machine with linear kernel, i.e. SMOreg)
</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Unpack the archive by keeping the directory structure (e.g. using <code>tar xvzf
recognizer-1.0.2.tar.gz</code> or Winzip).<br><br>
<li> Edit the <code>PersonalityRecognizer.properties</code> file in the root directory appropriately, by specifying the paths to 
<ul><li>the <code>PersonalityRecognizer</code> installation directory
<li>the <code>mrc2.dct</code> file from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database
<li>the <code>LIWC.CAT</code> dictionary file from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2001
tool</ul>
You can specificy either Unix or Windows paths, the file <code>PersonalityRecognizer.properties.win</code> is an
example configuration file for Windows.
<br><br>
<li> <b>If running under Unix:</b> <ul>
<li>Make the <code>PersonalityRecognizer</code> and <code>compile</code> files executable
<li>Modify the environment variables in the <code>PersonalityRecognizer</code> shell script in the root directory, including the paths to the Java installation directory and to the Weka jar file.
<li>The program can then be launched using the <code>PersonalityRecognizer</code> command.
</ul>

<p><br>
<li><b>If running under Windows:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Modify the environment variables in the <code>PersonalityRecognizer.bat</code> batch file in the root
directory, including the paths to the Java installation directory and to the Weka jar file.
<li>The program can then be launched using the <code>PersonalityRecognizer.bat</code> command.
</ul>
<p><br>

<li> <b>The program takes the following options:</b>

<pre>Usage: PersonalityRecognizer [-d] [-m model_number] [-o] [-c] [-t model_type] [-a output_arff_file] -i file|directory
 		-c,--counts		Also outputs feature counts, -d must be disabled

 		-d,--directory		Corpus analysis mode. Input must be a directory with 
                         		multiple text files, features are standardized over 
                         		the corpus and the recognizer outputs a personality 
                         		estimate for each text file.

  		-i,--input       	Input file or directory (required)

 		-m,--model       	Model to use for computing scores (default 4). Options:
 	              				1 = Linear Regression
   	            				2 = M5' Model Tree
              					3 = M5' Regression Tree
              					4 = Support Vector Machine with Linear Kernel (SMOreg)

  		-o,--outputmod   	Also outputs models

  		-t,--type		Selects the type of model to use (default 1). The appropriate
                        		model depends on the language sample (written or 
  					spoken), and whether observed personality (as perceived 
  					by external judges) or self-assessed personality (the 
  					writer/speaker's perception) needs to be estimated from the 
  					text. Options:
  						1 = Observed personality from spoken language
                                		2 = Self-assessed personality from written language
                -a,--arff               In corpus analysis mode, outputs the features of each text into 
                                        a Weka .arff dataset file, together with the predicted scores.
                                        New models can be trained by adding features and replacing the scores
                                        by human estimates. Each line corresponds to a text in the corpus 
                                        indicated by the filename feature.
</pre>
<br>

Given a text file or a directory, the program will output personality scores for the Big Five
dimensions at the standard output. Feature counts and a textual representation of the models can be
shown using the -c and -o options, respectively. In corpus analysis mode (option -d), the recognizer
estimates the scores of each text in the specified directory, and uses standardized models
to improve accuracy in the target application domain. By default, the recognizer estimates observed 
personality using models trained on spoken language data, but the option '-t 2' switches to models
of self-assessed personality from written language, i.e. estimating the writer's own perception of 
him/herself.
<p>
For example, the following Unix command computes personality scores (self-report) for each text in 
the <code>examples</code> directory, using standardized SVM models trained on written language: 
<p>
<code>PersonalityRecognizer -i examples -d -t 2 -m 4</code>
<p>
The output of this command can be found in the file <code>output.txt</code>.

<a name=addFeat></a>
<li><b>How to add new features to the models using my own corpus?</b> <p>
While the models need to be retrained to include new features, 
this can be done using the -a and -d options to write the LIWC and MRC feature values of your corpus to a Weka <code>arff</code> file, 
(as well as the personality score estimates). New features can be included
by adding new attributes in the <code>arff</code> file, and making sure that the feature values are standardized over the full corpus. 
The model can then be trained on your corpus
by replacing the personality scores (the last five attributes) by human judgements of each text sample. 
The Weka Explorer or Experimenter can then be used for comparing various models. 

<p>Creation of the <code>example.arff</code> dataset file based on the example corpus:
<p>
<code>PersonalityRecognizer -i examples -d -a examples.arff -t 1 -m 1</code>
<p>

The program architecture allows the user to easily include external Weka models by adding new directories under <code>lib/models</code>, and modify the model names array in the source code. A model file is required for each personality trait, with attributes matching those of the <code>lib/attributes-info.arff</code> file.
