another indexed field would significant hoping way via grouping/collapsing query time possible thanks. right looking snapinstaller seemed though deletion index directory would deleting files indexreader thanks. idea thought given document/field set would contain text single language write special token language e.g analyzer add my-special-token-prefix-esperanto token field query time assuming know language make required term. useful use morelikethis support see //issues.apache.org/jira/browse/solr-0 attached patch. url work please include full stack trace runtimeexception version tika using thanks. hi ryan dug client code natural inclination would go latter fits better would write test code implementing thing e.g create mock client use test request object. hi yonik ah explains little seen resin parameter used inside init method typically specified using tag know resin-specific yes would easier update resin runs unpack .war kind pain way knew get working versus jindi approach got special reason ask ongoing support init-param technique. typically run memory solr index update new index searcher getting warmed looking heap often shows ways reduce memory requirements e.g shall see really big chunk used sorted field see http //wiki.apache.org/solr/solrcaching http //wiki.apache.org/solr/solrperformancefactors. hi erik let us say grins different field besides used autocompletion would places would need hit change field besides terms.fl value layout.vm example selecteditemprop searchobjprops asking trying use latest support index uses product_name auto-complete field getting auto-completes happening see solr logs requests made /solr/terms auto-complete look like would expect work seem generating results odd try curling thing use would consider minimum set parameters get expected xml response ideas wrong thanks. hi otis exactly something similar nutch searches using ehcache http //krugle.com/kse/projects/efnjemx store rewritten query string serialized xml response way dependencies stable searcher/doc ids nutch reference get remote searchers depending entries cache hit docs xml representation storing xml might. believe code support handling form data sent put request logic make sure either unspecified application/x-www-form-urlencoded read body byte array use request convert string typically specified e.g use curl tool post data sent header since key/value pairs url-encoded believe standard assume us-ascii utf-0 would work well us-ascii viewed sub-set utf-0. hi upgrading solr noticed filtercache hit ratio dropped significantly previously enabled recording entries debugging looking seems edismax faceting creating entries sharded setup distributed search search string bogus text using edismax two fields get entry shard 's filter caches looks like expected similar situation happening faceted search even though fields single-value/untokenized strings using enum facet method shall get many many entries filtercache facet values look like item_ net result even big filtercache 0k hit ratio still thanks insights. hi would started using embedded solr back via patched version in-progress code base wondered paragraph said given current state solrj expected roadmap solr general would guidelines special circumstances warrant use solrj know back namely multiple indexes run multiple webapps handled multi-core generating lots http traffic handled dih maybe wanted tighter coupling front-end api back-end solr search system since integrated system hands customers restart container option anything got wedged might still issue commonly compelling reasons use solrj thanks. auto-generated unique value would like. hi robert confuses suggester says based spellchecker supposedly work shards issue got configuration shards already trying leverage auto-complete quick dirty work-around would add custom response handler wraps suggester returns results fields needs merge. hi running problem queries distributed among multiple shards return binary field data properly hit single core xml response http request contains expected data hit request handler configured distribute request shards xml contains b b looks like wind getting .tostring data actual data anybody else run done fair amount searching hits yet next step create unit test solr nobody raises hand walk thanks. hi ian public terabyte dataset project would good match need course means actually finish crawl finalize avro format use data free collections data around though none know target top-ranked pages. hi sorry noise finally realized running using java code enwikicontentsource lucene benchmark explicitly set fields push results solr. different schemas would combine results two schemas define third core different conf separate conf/solrschema.xml set request handler dispatches two real cores. ah yes would explain oddity saw order hits matching document boost since querying field omit norms really short. use characterencodingutf0 think shall get back stream utf-0 bytes db know mysqlxmlfield 's start array bytes returned jdbc call create string array using utf-0 encoding use bytes directly writing xml best thing make sure xml send solr starts line make sure converted text xml fields wrap fields. included bit information configure top-level sharding request handler use suggest component get npe get response results completeness pieces puzzle suggest-one suggest-one suggest-two thanks. hi chris would thought queries would allow thing supported currently standard query would recommend re-posting lucene user list. sounds like roysolr running embedded jetty launching solr using start.jar app container newrelic installed. think need create separate background process least case web crawling challenge efficiently use samza process simultaneously fetch many urls increase complexity process 's code wind manage either multi-threaded async fetch state hadoop-based crawlers limited number parallel reduce tasks fetching see nutch bixo examples e.g fetchbuffer another project involved past. tested impact certainly would cause index files read thus cached depending much ram available came big commercial user lucene think running something like fc0. general yes subset terms occur frequently remove terms easy longer search either part query phrase combine common terms following terms works well bit complex significantly grow index either requires data analysis generate target set common terms. hi uses character separate elements e.g state|city solr 0.x worked fine query gets distributed across shards get solrexception severe org.apache.solr.common.solrexception use fieldcache field neither indexed doc values state problem appears fl= state|city parameter getting split functionqparser tries use state field actually exists ignored field since q=state|city ca| find entries california known issue way disable parsing field names field list thanks. hi otis working project speak stefan friends going live separately something independent solr/nutch view search plumbing usable multiple environments makes sense view replicating core solr nutch functionality sucks sure outcome. hi would copied/pasted schema fields testbed schema based version solr using back dark ages version handy comment warning changing version fields multivalued default would checked docs realize behavior changed days would used http //localhost:0/solr/admin/schema.jsp examine field would seen thanks. hi especially yonik http //wiki.apache.org/solr/deduplication page mentions duplicate field collapsing later allow duplicate see mention deduplication happens search time normally requires field stored indexed efficiency might need fieldcache wondering status support thoughts potential thanks. hi ken given comments seemed describe using nrt opposite use case set solr use solr.mmapdirectoryfactory bother test whether nrt would better use case mostly sound like advantage focused things relating solr would love hear results someone testing batch indexing use case tested various xxxdirectoryfactory implementations please let know results testing. based experience using jira manner would agree mike automatically assign fix go path wind steadily growing wave deferred issues constantly getting pushed next. actual format extension b characters xml posted. hi yonik thanks fast response ok curious made bit confusing api well-formed xml xml parser happy reserved xml characters need escaped using org.apache.commons.lang.stringescapeutils seems work pretty well great advice let give try thanks. intermediate approach use find potentially similar files using apply accurate slower comparison determine true similarity data common get files due small text changes frequency term moves quantized bands changes a 0/0 ber hash get combining terms bands still get matches hashes individual. never tried sending anything utf-0 solr comment issues shall run based experience date would strongly suggest converting utf-0 post solr. run similar issue mix webapps non-solr guys use log0j rotating daily appender since supported default jdk logger mismatch log files produced would looked mention wrapping log0j logmanager big deal bit annoyance search reusable implementation find anything looked good since use resin resin support describing approach taking short-term embedded jetty usage shall back situation ryan arguing use apache commons logging 've enough fun nutch commenting discussion. seemed work thanks suggestion though using case anybody else reads shall need run tests check performance improvements hadoop workflows output always fresh unless interesting helicopter stunts yes default index always rebuilt scratch thus long primary key used reduce-phase key easy ensure uniqueness index thanks. hi documentation wikipediatokenizer specifically wondering pieces source xml get mapped field names solr schema example seems going date field example schema got goes body way get example thanks. hi michael build meant gui whereby user use special characters say quoting collection clauses programmatically build query without using query parser code wound write seemed like simple escaping quickly got complex convoluted e.g allow term get processed specially query parser ok case sounds like stuck escaping. hi erik missing change needed thanks much. problems knowing possible set case seems like minor tweak call solranalyzer though understand mark 's comment setanalyzer method says required using like docnum method call tell analyzer either default standardanalyzer whatever gets set explicitly still get used case term vector. sounds like hitting max url length 0k common default http web server using run solr web servers know let bump limit via configuration settings. hi moving towards embedding multiple solr cores versus using multiple solr webapps way simplifying build/deploy getting control startup/update process would hate lose handy gui inspecting schema importantly trying queries explain turned anybody tried dual-mode method operation thoughts whether workable issues would taken quick look supporting java code ideas would needed hoping easy approach whacking admin support code thanks. hi especially yonik grins trying solr resin following cloned/edited resin.conf file include mapping solr adding created /webapps/solr-nightly

jock far usage limited futzing resin config file add simple thanks. turn facets query facet=true facet.field= shall get back distinct values though might play settings e.g facet.limit=0 get results

parse html extract text first use nutch tika projects examples using html. hi got fields contain embedded xml two questions relating appears though shall need xml-escape field data otherwise solr complains find start tag embedded tags finds tag field expected constraint xml-escaping data best way handle kind related question would easiest way ignore xml tag data indexing types xml-containing fields seems like could define new field e.g set associated tokenizer something new create though would un-escape data ick parsing skip tags thanks. area might issues date range queries many docs run oom errors recent thread yonik others good suggestions ways avoid problem know impact would merging results use date ranges guessing low yonik would know best well 0-server configuration would work would 000m docs/server large number even data/doc small 0k real performance going heavily impacted nature data types queries shall need think distribute data avoid performance constrained worst case

parent documents represent information e.g bibliographic information parent document contain children child representing physical copy book information e.g think library multiple branches child documents represent books format available given branch think special set information need solr lucene make use facet based need facet counts child facets example harry potter last crusade j.k. rowlings upcoming block novel following information etc etc bit simplified actually fields involved child document five fields used individually easy combination much harder refine result set relatively straightforward approach location format ordinary everyday facet fields certainly get results although ignore facet counts search book without facets applied get back facets like narrow things work though logically hole trying fill example suppose user chooses narrow location branch format dvd still get hit back child record values user looking dvd 's branch library dvd main completely controlling indexing searching side code i.e formulate document content indexed parse results presenting users approach thinking brute force method accomplishing using facets using facet.prefix parameter query could generate 'facets like narrowing single facet e.g location branch would usual facet search something like would request back facets like parse values returned location-format_facet retrieve follows branch- prefix would facet values 'format facet presented users 'book remains value fields pretty straightforward could somewhat simplified two facet fields instead four keeping paired facets using singleton facets retrieving paired fields limiting taking place parsing pairs location format facets limiting element use facet.prefix limiting choose facets look concatenated value however gets complex ramp fields generally requires individual facet fields number underlying fields i.e two fields two facet fields needed solr/lucene index support three fields could facets required fields would required facets getting bit much hmmm little scribbling ok fair bit scribbling actually reduce facet fields cover fields maybe bad interesting actually coded anything yet paper-napkin level exercise thing done perused various archived threads upcoming functionality regarding parent child hierarchical document strategies found anything would help much least directly saw jira lucene-0 nested document query support looks slides overview structurally would indicates query parser support place yet i.e solr query able relate child level queries either within base query clause question finally logical problem seem resolvable approach brute force outlined willing dive solr lucene code would like indication people think would good possible approach get level e.g way providing indexer tuple found combination values something searching facet queries thanks. set new field concatenation 'field 'category group facet many combinations would talking field run
