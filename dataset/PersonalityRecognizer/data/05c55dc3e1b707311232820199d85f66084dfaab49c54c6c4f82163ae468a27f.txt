scale note xml schema anything syntax change operating pom instead pom postpone things forever let us find future-proof solution please endless discussions led nowhere far means need revert new import scope behaviour would mind see minor version increment model version far problematic others know else introducing new model building behaviour iam let isharm road better wrong course bad xml would make things like polyglot maven even harder since consumer pom something technical edited manually could keep xml forever xml parsers xslt processors available nearly every programming language xml makes sense solved way change semantics could used transform different syntaxes changes made bump model version syntax related fact diff pom-0.0.xml pom-0.0.xml difference would value model value would need deploy two poms summarize need find solution handling different syntaxes solution handle different semantics syntax going bump model versions must clear everyone increment means syntax different semantics minor version leaves patch version bug fixes like changing order elements combine.children attribute quite xml related better think model terms xml currently master would work sure model version increment without change syntax really issue however regards. maven team pleased announce release maven pmd plugin pmd plugin allows automatically run pmd code analysis tool project
