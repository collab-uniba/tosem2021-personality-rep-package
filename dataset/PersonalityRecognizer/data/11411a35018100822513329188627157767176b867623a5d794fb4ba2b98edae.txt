problem original poster two years ago solr using shard searching performing sharded query would get empty missing results documents querying shard individually worked anything shards parameter yielded result documents able get results back updating schema include problem seeing solr formulating queries go get records shard including square brackets around ids asking e.g delved solr code saw query string formed querycomponent.createretrievedocs simply calling tostring unique key field value document wanted get value objects somehow arraylists something like strings annoying square brackets showed via tostring emphasizing schema field single-valued lists would hopefully stop appearing think least brackets went away 's relevant querycomponent code check depending may need tha simple tostring comment seems fit theory
