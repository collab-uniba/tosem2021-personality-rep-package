anyone please help following sure done something wrong downloaded zip http//replaced.url warning problems encountered building effective model org.apache.parquet parquet-scala_0.00 jar:0.0-snapshot warning problems encountered building effective model org.apache.parquet parquet-scrooge_0.00 jar:0.0-snapshot warning highly recommended fix problems threaten stability build warning reason future maven versions might longer support building malformed projects error see full stack trace errors re-run maven -e switch error information errors possible solutions please read following articles error correcting problems resume build command. ok tried http//replaced.url seems build fine. written additional parquet-tools helper access files hadoop environment along lines existing parquet-schema etc scripts provided part parquet-tools distribution designed live location scripts hopefully others find useful determine path isdirectory else. attaching patch put together decimal includes added fixed bytes try make generic based branch avro logical support avro classes missing would need copy parquet fix schema getlogicaltype accessor need use instead think pretty straight-forward questions let know. sorry delay getting back investigating angles using tableau drill create views drill access parquet files even though parquet files hold schema create views cast columns correct data bigint float timestamp etc updates suggested parquet-avro add support timestamp urgent originally thought since cast everything anyway. thanks sounds need go trial local copies code would good check delayed contact http//replaced.url discuss. hi think pushing solr space probably going non-starter solr isfocus index management serving side things different multitude issues faced looking good free would try ibm isuses lucene hood fact wonder could reverse index create solr schema. could use lengthfilterfactory restrict terms least character long believe patternreplacefilterfactory creates patternreplacefilter says. providing maven0 build would useful us currently jar in-house maven repo works clean would favor changing directory layout selfish reasons would favor changing build rely maven0 use maven internally krugle sometimes works well times royal pain butt option would nice handy personally would hate foist maven everybody else. looked briefly passing analyzer use morelikethis fields lot analyzer used given filters play performance really stunk use stored term vectors would nice yes thanks. hi list anybody know suggester component designed work shards asking documentation implies since suggester reuses much spellcheckcomponent infrastructure spellcheckcomponent documented supporting distributed setup make request get exception looking querycomponent.java:0 code see assuming docs variable null would happen response element solr response make direct request request handler core e.g http//hostname:0/solr/core0/select qt=suggest-core q=rad query works see element named response unlike regular query wondering configuration borked work fact suggester return response field means work shards thanks. hi got situation key result initial search request let issay list values faceted top faceted field values need get top hit target request restricted value currently total requests requests following initial query made parallel still questions magic query handle solr as-is best solution create request handler case developing custom thanks. hi particularly uwe robert yes gist question specify use simpletextxxx e.g simpletextstoredfieldsformat solr currently possible thanks. grabbed latest greatest trunk make main.css .query-box height tall enough least mac 0/ff config character descenders get bumped fixed issue solr looks like contains anchor text missing constraints see .constraints css added main.css ianawd probably best way fix issue see css used intent set character gray seems silly open jira issues types things add noise list approach preferred thanks. hi marcus look new project called katta first code check-in happening weekend would wait monday look. clarify issue using actual user search traffic seo content expose example people commonly search java hint url static content page language part generating static pages based search traffic though might decide content favor see based popularity yes need automate content generation regular e.g weekly basis big challenges ran dealing badly behaved bots would hammer site wound putting content separate system would impact users main system generating regular report user agent ip address could block robots.txt ip necessary figuring structure static content look like spam many links page much depth constrains many pages reasonably expose project scores based code activity usage used rank content focus exposing early low depth good stuff could based popularity search logs anyway lot topic feel solr specific apologies reducing signal-to-noise ratio. thanks fast response beginning worry nobody read posts see http//replaced.url attached test code issue plus simple fix json case regards. hi part interesting work creating custom query parser writing unit tests exercised extendeddismaxqparser first created extendeddismaxqparserplugin used create qparser via query something like complexphrase query expecting complex phrase query parser get used ishappening local param treated regular text makes think conceptual model local params processing wrong ishigher level code pre-processing step first hoping d get disjunctionmaxqueries queries complexphrasequery would mean processing happen inside extendeddismaxqparser code pointers poke around thanks. hi upgrading solr noticed filtercache hit ratio dropped significantly previously enabled recording entries debugging looking seems edismax faceting creating entries sharded setup distributed search search string bogus text using edismax two fields get entry shard isfilter caches looks like expected similar situation happening faceted search even though fields single-value/untokenized strings using enum facet method shall get many many entries filtercache facet values look like item_ net result even big filtercache 0k hit ratio still thanks insights. must missing something isschema exactly original example schema look index using latest luke would need rebuild luke current lucene code since format version tried using solr/admin/analysis see query returning get server error numerictokenstream support chartermattribute looks like happy analysis triefloatfield searches index using solr/admin results single value e.g ideas might going thanks. hi yonik thanks fast response ok curious made bit confusing api well-formed xml xml parser happy reserved xml characters need escaped using org.apache.commons.lang.stringescapeutils seems work pretty well great advice let give try thanks. hi quick note caveat using slightly older version solr without fragile sense relies current working directory resin home directory b path must ./webapps/ anyway worth solrsevlet.java isinit method change beginning see instance resin specifying explicit location configuration data note relative original source least version parameter solr.configdir lower-case build deploy solr resin called solr-notes example is/webapps/solr-notes/web-inf/web.xml a. uncomment first three system-property lines noted comment work around bug resin b. add init-param section copy contents solr config directory /webapps/solr-notes/conf part edit specify location data directory repeat steps second different. answering question use corecontainer.reload core force assume got embeddedsolrserver running time everything happen correctly covers need find programmatically change settings using solrj programmatic way force course assumes able programmatically change location datadir another issue thanks
