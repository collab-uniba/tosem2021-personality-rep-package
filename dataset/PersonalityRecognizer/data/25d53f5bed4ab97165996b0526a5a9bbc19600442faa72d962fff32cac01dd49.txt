hi tried result build failure nice colored system seriously different imho misleading error message. sap eventspies used well useless would welcome review convoluted incomplete listener interfaces. point failing build lib 0.0-snapshot pom file result app failed build exists another lib 0.0-snapshot parent 0.0-snapshot abides app-to-lib version range note relationship parent lib dependency relationship instead parent relationship failing case build app correctly succeeds exists another lib 0.0-snapshot dependent parent 0.0-snapshot version range. oh sure parent allow version range hourah thanks let see option ok developers case think reason fill jira entry mean iterating set possible resolutions fail set fails acceptable resolution found fact happen failing parent relationship replaced failing well dependency relationship understand root cause failing build pom considered error stops whole process whereas failing resolve transitive dependency marks particular resolution path unacceptable continue search imho behavior depend relationship parent vs. dependency behavior cases vote continuing version range resolution thanks. higher resolution path build would fail well regards. looks aether thought manage kind issue direct dependency dependency selector given chance exclude dependency graph hint possible configure aether ignore lib 0.0-snapshot resolving version range thanks. hi says suggestions overcome issue explanation let projects three minimalistic sample projects http//replaced.url happens time versions bumped projects deployed remote repo parent 0.0-snapshot still remote repo parent 0.0-snapshot still remote repo parent 0.0-snapshot still remote repo parent 0.0-snapshot still remote repo maven tries build pom lib 0.0-snapshot fails parent 0.0-snapshot available anymore however imho build app fail another dependency resolution lib 0.0-snapshot parent 0.0-snapshot fact relationship parent lib dependency parent-child relationship build app succeeds even transitive dependency parent 0.0-snapshot resolved note app build successful day lib 0.0-snapshot turn evicted parent 0.0-snapshot still remote repo suggestions overcome issue builds failing every day build farm reason thanks ps content mail duplicated http//replaced.url. fyi use-case eventspies sap exactly described igor use event spy instrument hudson/jenkins instance monitor builds maven project thrown hudson/jenkins monitored customization maven distribution dropping files lib/ext setting maven easy upgrade regards. thoughts anything configuration items check could second clusterstatus timeout messages i'm getting reference clusterstatus stack trace out:000s thanks thoughts. ok fyi solr replaces file instead editing means webserver needs permissions directory delete create solr.xml file fixed longer gave ioexception errors. try bobo plugin solr custom request handler http//replaced.url time use boostqparserplugin boost queries something like boost b=log popularity foo use boost feature conjunction external custom request handler like bobo plugin boost work standard request handler. sake completeness query w/o which=type_s parent search_t item0 parent which=type_s parent search_t item0 detail first symbol magic http//replaced.url. trying automate startup/shutdown solrcloud shards noticed bit timing issue server bootstrap zk configs complete process i.e data conf yet servers fail start obvious solution start solr instance responsible bootstraping first way folks handling. anyone explain provide links. solr wiki described install solr tomcat managed chapter configuring solr home jndi mentioned success query top level page solr admin link works anybody help. thanks shawn i'll give upgrade try see helps. defaults text anyway remove entirely solrconfig never specify solr query portion still defaults text anyway. solr wiki says repeated question score stemmed version solr keywordrepeatfilterfactory added assist see example wiki reproduced stemmed original term get indexed don't see original term gets weight stemmed term would don't require filter gives terms attribute missing. thank reply try corrections realised actually logs error tomcat log says seems saying executed successfully dont see data solr though. hi i'm new solr try tutorial deploy provided demo application got basic understaning work however tried deploying demo tomcat unsuccessful anyway i'm trying create two example searchjsp resultjsp searchjsp send search parameter solr server resultjsp receives result solr server display question best way deploy application/ suggestion structure help/suggestion would appericated. look like special chars filtered index time replaced space would keep correct offset terms paste definition fieldtype shema.xml data looks like query first word following queries must match matching ignore characters like match substrings far following field definition schema.xml definition matching works planned highlighting special characters seem move tags wrong positions example searching jsdhfjk misses last letters words special characters patternreplacefilterfactory solr many bells whistles must get correctly working highlighting kind regards. needs batchsize fetchsize mentioned much internal details fetchsize important thanks. hi shared core even tried reloading using collection api still cloud view shown orange however said core working perfectly fine exception logs cloud view bothering. thanks good stuff don't expect make fix find i'd like make something allows file uploads via xmlupdatehandler well ideas thinking could send xml payload another would work thanks. thank much responses guys acl need make web service call find user access document hoping get search results call web service ids search results telling ids user access filter others returning back user acl role based definitely food thought need figure synchronization issues thanks. yes thanks. intention it's happy slotted great it's even finished working might offer something suggested wendy look decide think better hack works happy suggest moved it's lame it's always it's experimenting wanted somewhere put access don't see lame it's working prototype it's trying create replacement it's nothing wrong making prototype pointed wendy knew touched code quite it's interested working it's got access started right away let run absolutely nothing wrong problem committer either wants hack away let work. trying force 0-alpha-0 think declaration maven-project overriding thanks. it's really matter going support saying it's important much don't believe acceptable least put somewhere else people work thanks. i've cleaned everything tagged rc0 anything else need rolling vote. turning row containing supercolumns lots subcolumns row supercolumn lots regular columns yes would efficient unless really read subcolumns w/ query anyway case don't matter. check console output http//replaced.url view results. see changes
