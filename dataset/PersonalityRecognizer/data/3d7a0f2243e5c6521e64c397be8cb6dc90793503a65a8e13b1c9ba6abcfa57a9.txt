mention sorry ndoc finally reached point wouldn't work codebase anymore nullreferenceexception i've created docs sandcastle wouldn't got option creating static html files far tell please help us fix uses official approach still works. hi matthew i'm glad getting ids deleting separate query need it's dozens thousands ids delete it's strategy delete. something open-source like http//replaced.url instead. shown query ment please excuse tested lot little bit confused right query course select/ q=titleprocessed life start=0 rows=0 indent=on view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing list archive nabble.com. cool. hi wouldn't intentional course let see based traces. thanks guys would looking around tb total index million documents period days purge indexes.i estimated slightly higher side things it's feel would thanks. hello hope running jboss run solr simpler containers e.g. jetty oom things look better replicate less often e.g every minutes instead every seconds all/some -x__ jvm params actually help. working write tests feature get done soon send review thanks. ah yes important lucene mlt see term vector stored still able perform querying much much much less efficient way lucene analyze document variable default_max_num_tokens_parsed used limit number tokens parsed don't go details since don't really dug code p field don't stored either rather difficult re-analyze general note really understand mlt works look wiki read thorough blog post http//replaced.url regards. thanks informed advices thanks trey detailed point view clear search multiple fields grow slower search actual search model problematic search catchall field need know fields match highlighting fields indexed stored improve performance get rid highlighting use solr explain output get explain output fields need search fields test removing highlighting adding fields search improve performances best regards. hi saying seems logical currently case collapseddocs functionality functionality build computing aggregated statistics mind really documents collected order appear search result collapsetype adjacent saved order appear really need collapse group search result order collapsed need tweak code change collapseddocumentcollapsecollector document ids stored inside openbitset collapse group change arraylist example way order documents collapsed preserved think downside change increase memory usage openbitset memory wise efficient arraylist integers think real problem collapse groups become large hope answer question. hi everyone need lucene jars path seems solr-solrj solr-core jars enough http//replaced.url asking lucene jars could know jars required run thanks advance. thanks reply response ok sure internally educated don't store entire documents index going index way small created using nutch store entire documents pretty sure part. hello everyone newbie question find documents indexed across shards thanks much. empty path message becayse nutch unable find url url location provide kindly ensure url. hi memory problems oom solr suppose something fieldcache entries count fieldcache grows grows rebuilt commit commit every seconds memory consumption solr increased within day tried solve problem reducing cache sizes filtercache documentcache queryresultcache delayed oom exception solve problem memory consumption increases continuously possible reset fieldcache explicitly. hello question related local solr certain locations latitude longitude spatial search work query try make gives results however make query radius=0 gives results part containing starttier endtier need fix problem. hello i've trying integrate ner solr search get really good facets i've already managed plug search handler code get feel works i'm trying plug update request processor pull facets i've gotten kind stuck implementing i've bookmarked specific problem area bolded messages see 're using field content determine language though could specify many fields wished next need add chain update request handler like right i've used processor chains trim remove blank fields i'm quite sure using totally different request handler go 're good go indexing documents via curl dataimporthandlers etc query see results say indexing happened use query get results question /update handler used it's used index it's used search used /select search handler heck /update processor implement probably generic query use get results documents person organization field correctly populated index data question use information better/easier information finding users answer course resounding yes faceting field. brackets range operators parser need escape enclose quotes expecting \r. hi guys need help search handler need override solr it's scoring chose implement rankquery api gettopdocscollector gets called instantiates topdocscollector instance every dicid gets //initialized constrctor scorer.start //the scorer it's api needs call start every query close query get specific field doc using docvalues calculate score using scorer add docid score scoredoc object priorityqueue problem cant find place call scorer.close need executed query ends calculated score docid saw deligatingcollector finish method called collector done extend topdocscollector. really depends schema change addition/deletion usually implies avoid re-indexing old documents remain outdated change change data structures involved enabling docvalues norms ect ect without full re-index no-go lot discussions past allow solr manage schema changes fly background jobs transparent user/administrator nothing concrete yet know. discussion cites paper via url unfortunately go url get tracked paper reference may require subscription sorry us http//replaced.url journal american society information science technology. don't specific date far i'd like say year i've working svn head build solr noticed bug get committed fixed quickly found think need development features 're probably safe use svn head remember dev always test new builds actually using =p thanks zappos.com. hi appears happen trunk appears add command request parameters get sent nodes comment like add commit things work expected otherwise params like stream.url gets sent replicant nodes causes failure file missing worse repeatedly importing file exists replicant might right thing sent. it's bit tight index cached best bet go 0gb+ figure way retrieve many stored fields. hi done anything yet radar sometime month speaking unencumbered experience substantial understanding shingles would great select shingles something like terms prefix combines single token could set max shingle find way use terms component shingled i'm interested find please post back find something outside mailing list thanks see something like solr enterprise search server book well worth money believe ebook version. company search uses stopwords quezary time stopwords list entries like ltd. search companies like hr club get results similarly search india hr giving results get results query following companies would still maintain list stopwords since please guide need change strategy thanks. using following defines query hightlight body elements html documents set hl.fl highlightcomponent body result bigram cjktokenizer highlighted regards. attached patch well fix could please confirm. it's interesting approach i'd consider question essentially get indexschema solrj client without needing parse xml file hopefully i'm afraid don't work index empty luke don't return fields fields written method returns information i'd like know know field
