hi well aware maven default build.finalname unfortunately look eclipse packages source artifacts corner case example snippet list bundles plugins directory eclipse problem maven-eclipse-plugin isto-maven intended serve default tool create maven artifact eclipse correctly recognizing bundles source suffix source artifact corresponding java artifact instead creating new java artifacts contain compiled java classes java sources assumption ask eclipse guys completely revamp builds account maven isbuild.finalname defaults would possible fix maven-eclipse-plugin generate correct maven provides possibile fix would possible apply thanks. hi current implementation maven-eclipse-plugin isto-maven given following two bundles according maven conventions create two artifacts groupid artifactid version using classifier source second bundle instead creates two completely unrelated artifacts creates problems using -ddownloadsources=true trying ago attached patch could please shed light wheter reasoning correct thanks. hi others post worth specialized resolution wrote similar requirement may help similar requirements running wanted able return facets matched actual search rather facets entire result set example user searches author twain present list facets match twain exclude facets twain found tell users facet values present alpha-sorted list author names count associated documents search author search field identify matching documents get facets i.e normal solr processing point filter facet set include match original search added extra facet parameter facet.sirsidynix.filter.facets instruct solr special facet filtering modified simplefacets method gettermcounts right final return counts like added method filtercounts basically wrapping things run search facet value setting instances based schema inserting facet value running original query anything matches score ones keep filters counts entries match original query using lucene isfast in-memory single document index queries run string value count create run original query anything score means hit value matches original query retain score means hit i.e facet value associated document matched query facet value match query param field field facet values came original search would initial_author_srch_boost well string time shove single-values initial_xxx fields good enough query able correctly bit explanation schema order suffixed facet fields _facet hence first statement matching searchable facet fields names basically differ suffix strip _facet append _boost _fuzzy two field types searching possibly applying boosts fuzzy matching shall see exactly hopefully modify version match schema basically idea derive field original search issued facet field shall read see works rather re-iterating anything date faceting ranges anything facet prefix handling may may work need prefixes anything else facets handle least test say special case us way intended general solution fit prime time submission solr enhancement. maybe jumping gun bit known location maven-changes-plugin i've checked don't seem find. changes version include use relative paths directory properties issue mpant-0 thanks changes compile tests run junit present ant display automatically install plugin following single line manual installation download plugin fun. using forkmode pertest log0j output console. looked links provided seems good. following issue updated full history issue see. none new features available public use yet 're focusing making drop replacement first don't think anyone us http//replaced.url don't know thanks. believe maven-invoker intended run maven maven-verifier hand appears conglomerate functionalities experience maven-verifier core rather limited favor separation concerns wonder whether don't split instance maven-verifier could either directly depend plexus-utils instead duplicating classes sake core classes need different names could use shade plugin relocate stuff allow pre-/post-build hook scripts invoker plugin easily check asserter something holds path current directory e.g base directory project path local repo offers several assert methods really feel something nothing invoking maven could properly designed serve core well hook scripts used eclipse plugin. following comment added issue chance mpear-0 mpear-0 could looked rc0. hi guys following surefire-0 wonder get progress feature even optional surefire/failsafe plugins idea likely rely scanning metric rely like classes avoid loading bytecode show progress bar give user console ee tck often testng listener really lacking plain surefire hope gets enhanced. proof-of-concept pr introduces support test sources organized module descriptors merge pull request git repository running alternatively review apply changes patch close pull request make commit master/trunk branch least following commit message. really don't know going provision toolchains without something settings means core changes i'll see i'm sure using properties fashion really maybe change simpler plugin configuration pom element introduced removes need plugin configuration set project level. hi folks pass core w/ external resolution outcome logs almost could find artifact org.apache.maven maven-settings jar:0 central file target/null alike -dmaven.it.central=http//replaced.url idea. hi i'd like release clover plugin v0.0 it's issue left jira don't quite agree content changes version include added maven.clover.multiproject property set true master project 're using multiproject setup setting true make clover goal maven-clover-plugin report pom execute subprojects i'll call new clover multiproject new clover multiproject goal run clover multiproject setup new clover merge goal creates new clover database merging several databases specified using maven.clover.merge.databases property maven.test.failure.ignore correctly reset clover fully disable clover clover clover compiler adapter fixed issue clover report calling clover leading fixed issue clover task definitions using explicit apparently breaks maven changes ensure clover init clover clover called example calling clover twice row execute clover -report goals call clover test anymore generates clover reports clover report always generate clover reports even coverage data reason clover generates metrics coverage like loc ncloc useful issue mpclover-0 removed maven.clover.jar property used override clover jar property working requires ant clover license need point maven.clover.license.path please cast votes it's thanks. following comment added issue ended way call goal using attaingoal using session required updated werkz release get it's pretty works sample webserver plugin. yes though users start asking questions m0 alpha release would answer user list different ones made primarily interested unified development core folks involved coding core worked m0 m0 brett act like bridges brett knows m0 still know things know m0 well whereas michal trygve emmanuel familiar innards maven0 john casey probably entering mix soon long history supplying patches helping gave big patch maven0 fact brett likely person knows maven0 even though user. think would legible fetch push urls separated something part url normally ie instead would stand visually otherwise seems like workable solution current pom model. hi explain error means appears every report think found bug timestamp checking verifying. hi think sounds reasonable something like instead. i'm downloading source cvs run maven eclipse debugging session debug maven. far know first time saw trick/hack get michael mccallum tell us picked pom.xml it's wild depend feature may get personally strong attachment range ordering imply less 0-classifier would seem big regression breaking change 0.x. little surprised find m-r-p branch handles git committing branch version current branch making branch reverting version current branch make branch change version. hi guys someone tell nowadays maintains parser http//replaced.url bugzilla cvs longer available. position artifacts central never ever change it's something wrong new version needs deployed. seconds mng-0 show repository downloading uploading from/to. i'm afraid useless staging repo url transitory besides pom contain revision number neither benefit mailing archives completeness vote request assume mean. think would nice reasons listed jira issue created yet
