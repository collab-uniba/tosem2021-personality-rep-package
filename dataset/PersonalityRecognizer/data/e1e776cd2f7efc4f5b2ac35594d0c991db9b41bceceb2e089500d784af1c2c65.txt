hi using solr store time series data log events etc right use solr cloud collection cleaning deleting documents via queries would like know approaches people using way create collection receiving post inexistent inded could use date part index cleanup process would delete old collections. hi hoping someone thoughts running solr patch solrqueryparser.java getluceneversion calls use lucenematchversion directly running solr cores schema use solrj run searches java app running jboss jboss tomcat solr index folders server case relevant using jmeter load test harness running solaris processor box 00gb physical memory run successful load test user load rate solr searches second solr search responses coming 000ms tried ramp far tell solr hanging logging statements around solrj calls log long query construction takes run solrj query log search times getting number query construction logs corresponding search time logs tomcat jboss processes show well cpu still top processes cpu states show around idle usage two java processes around 0gb lwp state shows sleep jboss still alive get piece software talks jboss app get data set things use log0j logging solr log showing errors exceptions indexing searching back january load testing prototype problems though solr time ramped beautifully bottle necks apps solr benchmarking descendent prototyping bit complex searches fields schema basic search logic far solrj usage ideas else look ringing bells send details anyone wants specifics. hoping sort work multivalued field normally trying makes sense example two authors document would expect document sort issmith jones probably specific rule choose least generic sense wanted example able sort first author could index first author separate non-multivalued field purely sort still authors multivalued field join conversation like us facebook follow us twitter. set new field concatenation field category group facet many combinations would talking field run query something bit similar wanted author search author field documents field set based author search well field based author faceting search author field return results facet values display facet values counts users select issue new query return documents author facet value. setting reading thread seems could search macman hit macman maecman since seems could map single replacement mapped multiple times generating multiple tokens thanks view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing list archive nabble.com. make field multi-valued field indexing time split text sentences putting sentence solr document values mv field think normal highlighting code used pull entire value i.e sentence matching mv instance within document i.e put overhead index step rather trying search time. put default value group_id field solr schema would work e.g something like unknown shall get original group_id value still grouped together figure display time. i'm trying build following solr cluster seems solr don't use different config trees zookeeper certain time even manage get state 'configs node solr seems like picks looks config files single picked thus get messages like zookeeper node found assuming see node zookeper configs node looks like i've tried many different ways solr.xml editing none helped setting full paths collection error says invalid path setting relative paths collection error says cant find zookeper node searchs defaultcollectionpath+relativepath running core solr doesnt see collections idea even possible current solr version thanks. issue commit delete specify delete command. moved master/slave believe happened i'merge help least don't see performance problem master. someone confirm needs reported bug exception patch seems different solr-0 issue sporadic occurs every time graphite reporter regards replaced email.addr.es wrote. please southern california area. search 'referal_url http//replaced.url wildcard start cause dictionary scan every term search unless use reversedwildcardfilterfactory could cause slowdown i/o bound even cpu bound matter. hi guys i've noticed new features solr termscomponent enables autosuggest puzzles actually use application autosuggests case insensitive difference it'san francisco it'san francisco i've tried 'text field it'string field joy string providing best result still case sensitivity moment i'm using custom field converts field lower case allows submit query lower case better good results point email find get autosuggest return mixed case results require lower case query send. first question whether 're sorting and/or faceting many unique string values i'm guessing sometime questions help pin fields sorting fields faceting many unique terms see solr admin page best. believe sortmissinglast fieldtype attribute fieldtype sortmissinglast= true. currently logged normally container access log currently logged currently logged number documents matched it's higher level concept rather specific request handler info returned responses though it's response would largely meaningless general could determine number parameters number docs matched better number might response normally fields could small large faceting highlighting data could dwarf size/speed due main response. hello far know don't remove response numfound start docs response prepared solr apart removing header don't anything. hi trying upgrade solr instance use solrj api fetch data index see solrj version compatible index generated known issue workaround thanks. yes url something like. hello saw taxonomy faceting slides http//replaced.url question many taxonomies document apply dont know many taxonomies cant define field schema taxonomy field taxonomy use feature need know handle context document apply taxonomies cant define field taxonomy schema dinamyc solr handle. chosen use improper field names fl parameter need reference using field function basic concept solr don't ban improper field names don't work contexts. need two clauses something like could work best. hi may silly question sure contraindication run solrcloud java thanks patience. i've gotten far better answers already use spanqueryparser maintain published maven central carry nlp would allow literal headache headache shows within words http//replaced.url http//replaced.url. store solrinputdocument filesystem sent solr server via solrj client using quartz job periodically query table contains listing solrinputdocuments stored java.io.file need thanks time. question trying prevent big bad world stuff don't supposed solr going prevent big bad world posting delete query restrict hitting admin console looking schema.xml question big bad world internet large employees/colleagues organization it's internet large i'd totally decouple solr b/c sure thing internet access get /select restrictions could done many places it's clear coupling solr place big bad world within organization basic protections around don't see saying reasonable perhaps another option consider query component rather creating sublcass request handler query component promotes re-use flexibility could make necessary parameter changes prepare method make sure safe parameter component comes query component list components handler fine. currently calculate twice documents returned significant rows set. jetty running port running ports defined instances sequence apache0 reverse proxy front. don't indicated problem symptom actually think problem comma operator solr query parsers comma another character may may included discarded depending specific field analyzer example white space analyzer keep commas standard analyzer word delimiter filter discard string punctuation would preserved including commas spaces spaces would need escaped let us know symptom though first mean filter query looks perfectly reasonable abstract. nevermind got details thanks view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing

dynamic ones regards linkedin http//replaced.url time quality nature keeps events happening lately don't seem working anonymous via gtd book. don't delete 0s ,0s etc field value keep text format i'll apply slop search needed search done. hello new solr trying understand sort functionality working thanks advance help following questions taken default download started solr posted mem.xml updated
