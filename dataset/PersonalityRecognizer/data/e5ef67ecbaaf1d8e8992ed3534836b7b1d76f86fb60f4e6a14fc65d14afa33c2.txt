double slashes issue scm-0 opened mng-issue contains simplistic patch fix relevant test case fix might bit invasive affects url scm connection url alternative perhaps normal tests passes suppose original code removes double slashes reason avoiding http redirects perhaps anyone know oh documentation mentions profile integration tests -p run-its maven tells profile. think actually tracked defaulturlnormalizer module maven-model-builder indeed part maven-core defaulturlnormalizer following element scm/connection removes double slash hostname part url normalization occurs release plugin find plugin descriptor instead mavenproject.getscm .getconnection used retrieve scm url method returns scm connection url normalized important double slash removed somewhere lost maze maven-core sorry pinpoint issue better. hello understand strictly concern blocker release maven scm-0 still blocking upgrade 0.x including 0.0-rc0 anyone using mercurial hg scm absolute paths remote server maven release plugin chance get fix included. right weeks ago made weak attempt look source code scm module found nothing obvious something wrong url component actually parses pom.xml extracts string scm/connection element maven use scm url mercurial contains absolute relative path handed hg mercurial looks project wrong place release build checkout fails mercurial special non-standard url annotation two consecutive slashes hostname separate relative paths absolute paths example scm url works fails 0.x double slashes localhost tells hg file path absolute file system located /opt/foo double slash removed hg instead search directory opt/foo relative home directory user server perhaps /home/luser/opt/foo. fill kip purpose kips give full overview feature work implemented considerations involved etc like sentence wouldn't enough anyone know thinking moving configs something i'm guessing would zookeeper-based massive change really need describe way widely circulated actually think would good idea advantages good old fashioned text files terms config management change control trying support may may better. current implementation producerperformance creates static payload useful testing compression test production/custom payloads decided add support providing payload file producer perf test made following changes added support provide payload file list payloads actually send moved payload generation inside send loop cases payload file provided following changes producer-performance evoked must provide payload-file record guaranteed using custom events earlier required config must provide exactly payload-file providing result error support additional parameter payload-delimiter added defaults merge pull request git repository running alternatively

efficient fact basic regex subscription causes consumer request metadata topics great. i'd like start vote kip-0 add command line tool offsets details thanks best regards. nexus scheduled maintenance fall i'm trying cut release nexus appears dead thanks. would consider something like sfl0j something part api think it's fine expose something like i'm sure holds true cdi would wouldn't better completely hide thanks. think it's really ok default trunk mode maybe unless checking tag main project it's feature remember clearly would i've enjoyed first time ever tried change something maven clearly checking repositories like crazy building dependencies finally managed find thing interested time felt like built half known universe components reached goal similar-sounding names hey wouldn't check course workspace-plugin would keep pom changes top-level project separate commit wouldn't mess actual changeset could support patch command. need rephrase change documentation release process update fixed -latest place svn copy release svnpubsub give us expected regards. dependencyset specify following things. following issue deleted jira. hi custom enforcer rule occasionally failing looking code defaultartifact appears related error fixed getversionrange could field getter protects maven happens running jdk com.nds.cab.build.enforcer.engineeringreleaserule.execute

exhibit behaviour multi-module projects several modules pass hits wouldn't like message confidential intended addressee received message error please immediately notify replaced email.addr.es delete system well copies content e-mails well traffic data may monitored nds employment security purposes protect environment please print e-mail unless necessary. looks interesting eric soon definitive place add link maven site. found bug modello plugin breaking /any/ build using modello multi-modules i'm fairly sure kind issue found elsewhere quite simply it's use plexus components singletons mojos contain per-request mutable state since you're short time away beta-0 wanted know think done treat documentation problem maybe update guidelines regarding singleton usage maybe keep list known b add kind isthreadsafe attribute metadata could used assert run concurrently without something else thoughts b done. android maven plugin team pleased announce release version plugin com.simpligility.maven.plugins new features/bug fixes specific release fix allow release-plugin ides correctly consume aar deps http//replaced.url would like thank contributors release valuable help invite help us well specifically release would like thank following contributors awesome work would like thank help received maven community members everybody else help received issue tracker beyond documentation issue tracker found plugin websites http//replaced.url http//replaced.url enjoy congratulations everyone involved http//replaced.url. hello benson looking http//replaced.url maybe could point maven users developers general better installing jdk regards mirko. really called beta release criteria could vote it's beta. i'll leave guys suggestion make submission package contains references repos userids clas file userids new clas along clas send email pointer repo perms plexus people add userid cla file directory new clas may get i'm sure active plexus mailing list send message herve collect together see discrepancies deal ask legal covered clas acceptable submit it's ok great start trying expunge thanks. please add new version ant-contrib ibiblio. never heuristic replace people taking apis testing without combination part project external party trying collect metrics use probably going great value retaining api compatibility along high degree coverage probably useful metric really it's conscious effort api broken even inadvertently mechanical turk going help us much implementation metadatarepository api it's costly deal dependencies currently pom swizzling deal ranges number possible paths grows quickly sat solver fast could predigest dependency information pre-calculated subgraphs probably useful change range path you're recalculating anyway boil something far simpler sat solver guaranteed find working solution ranges set set fixed weighted say pom fix version depman change calculation like fixed fix let sat solver find solution magic already osgi resolver tycho thing p0 uses sat it's osgi made clear it's osgi proper use right osgi resolver simple state machine it's p0 osgi resolver even though retrieves ultimately fed osgi thanks. sure anybody apache say yes synchronization ibibilio codehaus repos i've got. maybe something get/ set tags wouldn't make changes anyway wouldn't think important worth hassle. split verifier improve cli performance core plugins -target committer free call vote minimum etc. crawl designed kind issue mind long thanks. questions specific closed issues might warrant really implemented intended close wouldn't fix knowledge feature delete issue unless completely mistakenly filed think close incomplete/wo wouldn't fix otherwise it's impossible get back information lost think would useful thing add patch still applies part bootstrap check released version reopen wouldn't really sure fixed patch date eclipse code site good reopened patches optional non- default functionality patches specific problem keep open updated right thanks
