way query table based binary column bytes proofpoint inc. sql query looks part like sometimes returns port values ip column ip values port column delete group first/last sections seems work fine run query cores runs fine fail part number cores effecting bug makes pretty sure israce condition along fact printing values changes bug have looked client code not seen anything obvious occurred suppose could server code anyone else seen anything like proofpoint inc. done. fine would like note first announce publically users mailing list think deserves major bump plugin version wdyt. hi changes since last release. would favor move java make strong use nio0 file operations lot pain go away. could announce least five days advance would give least timeframe merge prs handle issues. think must tandem packaging zip finally. yes works stupid fault simply noticed use secured url used read-only url sorry noise. yes maven mvn -prun-its install build.log files say updated msite mpir projects touched subversion. would drop altogether go. hi paul good idea done already pre-0.0 versions going think strictly follow no-fix-version-for-incomplete/invalid/wontfix able assign real versions great. hi staged site http//replaced.url. rather add plain text release notes html junk unreadible. not course solve problem pre-existing files give clean way things right new files. given companies/folks react something discontinued would move java baseline christman first release java e.g. policy make apps run java months even compatible not concern. help becuase repos located github apache. non-binding. cloned tested upgrade msite pain go away parse/ include. possible ran uts twice check dep tree mediated. thanks announcement actively providing several years finally able contribute officially directly thank. confirm tried wagon 0-snapshot maven master. glad found documentation hard would like repeat information serveral places need update maybe interpolation issue please open jira issue thanks. hi vote passed following result promote artifacts central repo pmcs please promote source release zip file add release. hi folks in-house project jcl-over-slf0j nothing special far module dependends net.sf.michael-o.dirctxsrc dircontextsource jar:0 compile slf0j-simple test scope mvn dependency tree properly gives master gives questions another fix master relied erratic behavior core previously depmgmthave influence transitive deps direct really say right wrong two slf0j bindings slf0j simple logback obviously wrong thoughts. please reply promotion http//replaced.url would like manage release like codehaus jira thanks. insane works thank much need fix fail w/ maven 0.x due aether advise must raise mpir msite mksins-0 work anymore may others. yes http//replaced.url obstained merge patch version minds course. hi folks seems like full access maven directory see anyone able check error correct permissions username michaelo thanks. thanks summary helpful keep everyone loop pmc don't decided particular dev agreed last week nice blocker fix asap don't make include fix shortly document situation welcome efforts tag team issue don't hold. hi passing since=n parameter reconnect changes feed feed=eventsource think changing format changes feed suit eventsource spec don't change. sorry follow jan probably post new email summarising result thread consensus move forward along minor details plans. configure work without flags. group_level rejected single key specified. servers testing working 0.0b000000 weird 0.0b000000. thanks testing used approaches problems please see thoughts commit messages. hi still problem ran things try code http//replaced.url trying login still get reason password someone try runs machine missing something stupid. don't think case clear cut paul points certainly borderline would like think devs think. thanks feedback couchdb github development happens http//replaced.url wholeheartedly agree lot work went allowing us make stable releases faster said world framework week 're database means things different pace couchdb responsible many magnitudes terabytes data core many crucial business civic infrastructure healthcare applications users trust couchdb hold data reliably it's responsibility seriously things happening deliberate necessarily slower pace realise makes couchdb less attractive casual contributor make better areas see relevant think collectively appreciate slower pace everyone enough time keep everything make sure everybody chance think new code thus reduce amount errors shipping best. someone create us. minimum get auto-apply patch service going i'll try soon. hi thanks answer javax.xml.ws.soap.soapfaultexception object reference set instance object instance object. hi i'm confused correlationid generated configuration piece follows think rules generating correlationid follows it's left side condition it's right side rule generation correlationid usercid means client gives correlationid conduitselectorprefix means client configures wsdl useconduitidselector means client configures wsdl conduitid means string generated jms-tranport it's jmsconduit index autoincreasing number indicates uniqueness right use rules generation correlationid best regards. thanks freeman looks fine yes it's bit tricky make sure works across jax-rs providers especially custom mbrs expecting inputstream null. don't worry typos happens time confirm show annotations retained runtime don't deal it's job ejb factories/proxies/etc deal thing need provider ask container-specific ejb factory/etc create release instance see may work principle please accept cxf manage instantiating ejb resource classes delegate ejb factories may keeping pools thus don't need reference jaxrsserverfactorybean fact don't need object reference ejbprovider resourceprovider impls reference ejb resource needs passed constructor definitely need cache create objects reason thought debugging would help. don't outstanding messages case could go ahead terminate sequence messages add terminate message db upon restart similar messages would sent terminate sent thoughts. yeah think good idea put cxf dosgi separate project jira thanks. hi place need know cause soap fault org.apache.cxf.databinding.source.xmlstreamdatareader saop fault throw don't know exactly error cxf server put production client developed people outside company difficult client trace real error cxf don't send cause exception back client lots place cxf throws fault/soapfault message changed fault. i'm going start omnibus thread. could please raise jira thanks. usually spits java version found. thanks fusesource part red. stems discussion back guides live built site intention would move simply need copy code branch check site branch got tired reminding people keep synch stopped. merge pull request git repository running alternatively review apply changes patch close pull request make commit master/trunk branch least following commit message. hi intellij basically pain generated code stuff way typically deal use intellij go root directory go intellij reimport whole maven project able see everything may go project settings make sure sources generated avro maven plugin included sources module uses sdk core hope helps let us know continue run trouble
