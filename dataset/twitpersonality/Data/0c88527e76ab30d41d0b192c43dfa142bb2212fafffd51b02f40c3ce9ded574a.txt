use injection techniques add logging sounds eh interesting would elaborate. sure msdn library says fileshare.read allows subsequent opening file reading change fileshare.readwrite allows subsequent opening file reading writing might better luck hi quick question using rollinglogfileappender webservice logging works whenever try open log file reading another process get sharing violation log file open file would enable minimallock way use exclusivelock another process read log file kind regards. rebuilt log0net library strong key message log0net missing strong project. browsed log0j isdocumentation little came across file appender listens port certain signal comes rolls file i.e closes current file renames starts new file windows alternative sending hup signal make work would sort external log rotation tool complexity log rotation tool could arbitrary could simple windows think solution. would suggest try find locking file tool handle freeware tell split sec see another instance log0net someone/something trying read file latter case lucky specify reader open file read-only shared mode blocking gone case always good idea see problem really changes. well wrote log0net-0. reference strong file assembly info assemblyinfo.cs use attribute assembly replace empty string file. ok urban understand think find looking inside framework though question since use short form format specifier r mean use old version using took find list format specifiers way solve problem would use timestamp r process log file separately would quite easy calculate differences using excel example really small note maintainers nicko text manual page mentioned says conversion specifier starts percent sign followed conversion character correct. interop component vb components use interop component error tracing logging interops handle config files well hence using xml file config file load set rollingfile appender properties understand like app.config file put log0net configuration application put log0net configuration using normal log0net configuration syntax separate file e.g logging.config configure application simple line main program xmlconfigurator.configure new make sure use configureandwatch absolutely difference log0net reading file code reading specially-formatted file besides course upside reinvent whole configuration code. since currently way conditional settings config file would say implement condition code clean way would use custom property e.g friendlyappdomain set startup either current appdomain predefined constant depending appdomain looks use property configure file would still make application fairly flexible comes configuring file future still change filename anyway without recompiling personal opinion yeah ask anyway cleanest solution today would different config process imagine someone else know log0net make changes app probably go source diving order figure mechanics behind file naming scheme two config files less elegant completely straightforward him/her understand future might able two appenders different configuration inherit common properties virtual appender something like discussed. tested chainsaw java web start great thing liked production environment web application would much appropriate anyone experience thing favourite personally running apache/tomcat considered. yes reason sometimes takes generate argument log.debug code looks something like would course benefit using instead since time-consuming generation message occur log string literals suppose point using. hi guys feel little stupid matter much browse sdk zilch application detect internal error occurred see case bad configuration file detected testing logmanager.getrepository .configured detect errors say fileappender reason unable open file vague memory seeing noappendersconfigurederror find let us turn question something general would think examples good practises implement personally would like series tests startup app make sure people running applications skilled necessarily developers get decent information something happens. really simple solution loggers create note logger longer static counter keep track instances could course replaced something sophisticated naming logger. sounds good thresholds/filters distributed loggers log events thresholds/filters applied logging server injected remoteloggingserverplugin case need simple way distribute logger-specific parts config file distributed servers btw thanks excellent job support mailing list simply beyond comparison wrote. thinking along new requests features rolling file appender comes really done logrotate unix tool specialized rotating log files today googled around little astonishment realized seems like made windows port logrotate really strange apparently logs files opposed event log database windows way servers log files like iis generally include rolling mechanism reducing need still store log files matter many variables think set limit rolling file appender leave fancy parts external solutions even means us build log rotating opinion rolling file appender already grown complex several configuration parameters whose side effects cooperation parameters hard foresee without reading source anyone knows windows port logrotate please shout. sorry line became complicated necessary isget say. timestamp since start application creation logging event. well ilog interface isxxxxenabled methods solve situations need address current log level. dear question general kind use log0net system architecture involves remoting consider example enterprise system consisting webserver w companys dmz application server inside business logic components connects database d. sometimes business logic components need call components server hosts kind third-party software calls w using .net remoting calls using yes realize reveal person previously forced work dcom world question still still .net world several reasons wanting distribute companys software several servers consider ways go configuration file every server let every component logging locally means logging info single call spread machines passed merge changes configuration duplicated many machines next level might configure remotingappender machines logging persisted transmitting single machine hosts remotingserver sure flexible though local config files say deliver everything remotingappender much say logging server remotingserver picked event ugly solution might let every called component create instances loggingevent similar return array main app takes array logs dream solution might involve special remoting-aware loggermanager takes retreiving caching config files logging server transparently passes events shall logged repository logging server wish list looks like single config file rule darkness bind least place changes made place logging done appenders work net adonetappender netsendappender remotesyslogappender etc may course file logs windows event log machine code logs preferably know remoting scenario exciting problem decision wether log done logging level filters etc set config file another machine really ask would like must many ways think pros cons. using use standard xml escapes xml guru think values respectively course start wonder need put layout first place whole structure appenders filters layout stuff powerful infrastructure filtering routing files etc. give guys list shot helping. hi richard would much like see best give two major log viewers today chainsaw http//replaced.url opinion focused log0j apache/java environment unfortunately freeware viewer definitely space fill
