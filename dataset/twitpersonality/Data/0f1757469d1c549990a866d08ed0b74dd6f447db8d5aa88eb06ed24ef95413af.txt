please send mail. website looks great. hi problem documentation kind missleading must add new element config update existing need add. could post full query url see exactly query post output debug=query show us lucene query generated. something everybody get transitioning world solr/lucene schema describes possible fields absolutely requirement every document index fields unless define solr happily index documents fields missing feel free able define people parts documents choose perhaps common fields i'll form queries like ralph assuming field people sku parts continue path de-normalization it's another thing db wouldn't document index contain data need moment find asking join stop consider de-normalization. i'd give go solr wouldn't modify library. hi michael missed elevator component standard request handler add following snippet request handler http//replaced.url http//replaced.url. hi thing describe possible set uses spanfirstquery sure it's going post debug output. hi ahmet tried follow recipe adapting solr testing right first try gave message java least file license it's license proper format see logs complexphrase tried ran successfully hope ok. registered queryparser thing i'm running multiple cores could search successfully wouldn't split already separated field multivalued= true need able search call even catch go thanks helped lot. bq it's good reason small cluster small mean 000s nodes well good reason would system continue operate zk nodes lose communication rest cluster go completely clear though zk nodes definitely wouldn't need beefy machines compared solr data nodes since light-weight orchestration yea data node system might willing go node ensemble tolerate single zk node dying depends much cash willing spend availability level looking. hi trying index collection solrinputdocs solr server wondering call make add documents add collection call blocking function call would like know add call call would longer larger collection documents thanks. yeah sure send mail plain text spam filters pretty aggressive comes anything else glance problem i'm guessing user run solr wouldn't create permissions best. hi lance well actually copied whole configuration files instead added missing configuration fresh copy example directory implementation mean readers used seems performance actually still becoming better moment average dropped even lower 00ms comparison 00ms. probably may use sanitizer http//replaced.url. query indexer i'm impressed got 0s replication work reliably. still able search already-indexed data exists values limits reached suspect solr would commit continue indexing however chance use features dih mis-configuration caused import finish without indexing anything thus wiping data aside continually index search time almost every day using. requirement solr search finds string return entire text document emails rtf format process outside solr achieve say process outside process rtf document search result return original document able successfully solr core stand alone. replaced email.addr.es wrote artifact normally unique enough idea still useful please file issue jira. project uses maven 0.x support pom 0.x project requirement jdk version requirement parent deployed converted format read maven version sure understood idea let pom format project level tool envolve always deploy pom artifacts meta-datas format requires 0.x improvemement translatable way example globalexclusion could translated brute force exclusion. really ridiculous lukas got account today perceive asf don't see problem anyone entitled work wants don't think anyone came blame lukas choosing things interest help people appreciate nobody demanded payment special recognition think time consider alternative don't get http//replaced.url flame someone shreds demand someone else fix bugs worded strongly i'd choose current situation tended towards recently apache way i'm seeing whole lot respect henning i've publically mocked maven community thread various places already discussed 're really concerned 're going handling wrong way 're going participate i'll ask give others respect lot people contributing positively don't see discouraged hope find constructive inflammatory regards. don't think matters much long rc don't since i'll get confusing. hi agree something like mng-0 indeed help experience looking implementation find projectbasedirectory confusing would thought project module already things like project.basedir project.executionroot could don't use executionroot seems exactly think projectbasedirectory abstract i'd prefer concrete using basename config override global i.e environment variable based properties project specific values scripts right thanks. might interested developed extension sort jdiff maven plugin checks-out version defined property defaults current generates docs generated probably done adding links menu first attempt jelly code likely little sloppy anyone interested strictly related jdiff plugin submit many thanks. think wiki lacks commenting facilities rss etc makes poor mans blog platform publish first blog copy wiki link blog enable comments etc. ok i'll arrange vote around suggestion seeing far thing people seem like. oozie-0 support getting credentials cluster hcat credentials config empty oozie-0 dataset url contains spaces handled
