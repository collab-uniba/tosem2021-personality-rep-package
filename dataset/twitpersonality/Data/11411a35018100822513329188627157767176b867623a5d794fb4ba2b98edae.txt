problem original poster two years ago solr using shard searching performing sharded query would get empty missing results documents querying shard individually worked anything shards parameter yielded result documents able get results back updating schema include problem seeing solr formulating queries go get records shard including square brackets around ids asking e.g delved solr code saw query string formed querycomponent.createretrievedocs simply calling tostring unique key field value document wanted get value objects somehow arraylists something like strings annoying square brackets showed via tostring emphasizing schema field single-valued lists would hopefully stop appearing think least brackets went away isrelevant querycomponent code check depending may need tha simple tostring comment seems fit theory. outsider thing change seems completely sensible follows try treat dependency plugin versions words let 's merge focus work debuggint lib differences. would someone able fire services say basic zone host. thanks jean-marc n't use cloudera manager. unfortunately 's fair amount larger organizations use n't ignored reality imho. would check copyfield target field something updaterequestprocessors copies baring two field return put regards http//replaced.url. since going spin new apache bigtop rc0 see inline sounds like great. thinking little problem rest api solves honest agree completely n't think rest layer provides feature/function cql valuable except cases like described may common honest get excited creating separate project started thinking value-added services could delivered like capabilities riak etc think way components implemented believe might common needs reusable e.g maybe change spin bit focus services layer top cassandra instead rest interface services layer maybe change sign rest bigot. hi jason talking embedder stuff week looking batch jira issues filed time back n't really sure still problems could give component thanks. hi carlos something sequence changes plexus-spring yesterday started breaking archiva build validation errors change need make get things working n't changed svn redployed old version code latest snapshot repair build thanks. going leave couple reasons currently using maven-0-snapshot either needs sorted rolled back problem recently added pregoal clean clean thanks. hi stefan thanks reply authentication works however getting authorization error curl error unauthorized reason authorized access added reader list replaced email.addr.es someone 00example 0e.com futon able login email address successfully authorize command line curl idea thanks. analyzinginfixsuggester mini solr index it's working designed returning choices see don't think persuade oob took quick look solr-0 it's simple fix lines code change rest test code could consider applying patch code base using rather fully upgrading best. highlighting dependent data fed highlighter unless must re-analyzed see highlighting compressed files seems like odd use-case business reason need best. made progress writing analyzer basically added tokenfilters solr factory classes copy paste worddelimiterfilter course package. hi workaround use facet.query frange query parser. don't help unless move solr it's update processor book first character string field add integer value another field placed add-char-code.js file conf directory solr collection get value named field no-op empty test. hi use wild cards autocompletion lucene far better tools making good autocompletion since wild card term query passed configured query time analyzer comments use porter stemmer use german specific stem don't index time tokenizer defined possible behaviour undefined far know. used marklogic around months majorly used custom ontologies serious issues start asking search results default go regards. yes deprecated less typing curl commands solr don't default application/xml mystery. hi got problem unique key defined schema.xml difine query_id indexing says missing mandatory key query_id present root entity data-config.xml indexing product database unique key schema set unique key says missing mandatory key present root entity data-config.xml indiexing user query another table database user_id unique fix thanks index tables basically unrelated common fields thanks replaced email.addr.es wrote. hi recent version search real-time search feature require commit. hi don't give close work get cjkanalyzer cjktokenizer work lucene able get work solr look bright site least ant don't throw errors code don't going work since really don't handle chinese japanese characters look things lucene went archives found people used something similar maybe try way filterfactories let know goes kind regards. thanks looking query set solrj calling add make curl call. chance try checked nothing solr logs potentially need debug. check new documentation added today http//replaced.url collections link config sets following rules collection starts config set collection link collection starts shares config set link otherwise link created manually specifying explicitly creating collection http api boostrap_conf=true uploads conf set core solr.xml links conf sets collections creating conf set names match collection names collection linked config set manually update link new config command line util tool commands links collections config sets even make links starting solr first time start solr collections started find use link info created tool names match change link solr running would cores collection pick new config collections api http//replaced.url lucidworks.com. generally apache mahout http//replaced.url recommended clustering. hi integrating solr search website keywords would return 0000s records way solr get results pieces. hello many thanks replay. thought don't seem case. reason thought much complicated looking sources see going easy task thanks help view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing list archive nabble.com. hi fields schema dynamic fields storing stored= false case need atomic update two fields belong stored list fields need change dynamic fields stored stored= true would don't considerably increase index affect performance negative way currently partial/ atomic updates two fields make stored= true without make stored= false fields stored= true accommodate atomic updates could pls give suggestions thanks. understand every example suggested don't get don't possible post exampe schema+commands give error goal process incoming text add derivitave stored fields may look 0-dev updaterequestprocessor need change token value indexed value stored value perhaps custom fieldtype override. yes definitely sounds like bug grouping looks like forgets weight sorts
