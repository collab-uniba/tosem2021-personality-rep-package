works fine thanks herve. questions stackoverflow.com relating maven-indexer created tag re-tagged appropriately. hi herve username carlspring documentation site needs serious work lack thereof developer unfamiliar indexer must sources try figure deprecated currently tricky business unless willing invest lot time pray using right thing site documentation non-existant created separate module examples currently based tamas examples github great starting point need extended examples much illustrate bits pieces scattered across different sites gather things place make useful possible would like open issues jira chase guys filed issues order polish requirements close obsolete ones schedule relevant ones know need extra permissions gotten latest indexer work spring need using project would like add examples needs done order able fully drop plexus replace wagon code proper started working went vacation pressing work soon get chance look well kind regards. hi barrie nice hear back guys indeed jira account last time tried able assign issues could somebody please look working version maven-indexer dropping plexus polishing examples re-working certain bits api believe tamas still vacation surely explain thanks. hi would downsides like bind process need download remote repository isindex least usually small recall correctly maven centralisindex something like mb .gz talking top head recent work maven-indexer downloading index central order run tests took would people start saing oh maven slow build tool resolve million dependencies even slower switch some-next-cool-build-tool-goes-here referring maven slow lot people feeling takes ages build larger projects due resolution dependencies need update local index regular basis day least quite convinced would accepted well everyone could option dependencies could resolved mixed basis index use/update option specified ignore option specified saying current model best trying illustrate downsides switch kind regards. could always clone repositories fixes locally submit pull requests seems problem clearly questions lists right place ask. hi writing concerning bug misleading maven locks around quite preventing us able use distributed build system properly use hudson although possibility run build private repository reasonable solution large number builds due amount space need node hitting lot lately hudson running nodes using different operating systems maven problem described follows build snapshot module install locally work days commit code meantime changes module however maven-metadata-local.xml contains line tells maven update snapshots even -u using older snapshots locally solution remove artifact islocal metadata file edit manually comes regular dependencies written small plugin works around issues locked maven-metadata-local.xml files info however comes parents situation much trickier projects get loaded interpolated long would like ask proposed patch accepted/reviewed confirmed bug exists maven proposed patch david rousselie applicable maven copy five lines changesto another 0.x release could included could bug patch reviewed writing workaround plugins good idea using modified maven company therefore would like request issue fixed next version maven quite critical thanks advance looking forward replies regards. hi would like become maven committer lately contributing fixes maven-indexer current area interest working together tamas cservenak deeply familiar writing maven plugins large part core plugins see pulls currently working things maven-indexer well contribute knowledge free time project written quite plugins hosted github familiar contribution process pulls work look project already read stephen isblog becoming committer senior build release engineer agree approach believe fixes live high standard would privilege able join team kind regards time yearly committer school announcement become maven committer http//replaced.url committer.html let us know. hi furthermore feeling adding option artifact bound lead headaches hand could specify groupid includes/excludes repositories things could much better terms resolution times frankly think remote repository isjob first place people otherwise two different places handled making things complicated track later artifact routing rules exist. thanks accepting merging olivier. oh right seems broken recent merge believe 0d0ed0af0eff000ab000ae0c00d00f000e00bf0a safe revision rollback try things look get back. hi created account long time ago probably early late sure need re-register something. okay registered xcircles username seemed work. hi thinking whatever animal owl would really cool wearing sort super-hero outfit letter maven brought super-powers order proposal. hi kenneth version maven trying build building fine maven kind regards. hi looked commit 000ce000000000eb000c00c000000dd0d0baa000 seems try delete primary storage every time stopping vm maybe root cause kvm blocker bug cloudstack-0 kvm guest vms crashed automation test agent log find lot umount primary storage error never kind operation know add referring code. case seen check http//replaced.url really something go away gossip. looked jmx object however compaction manager support multiple threads moves 0-filesize time compact set files useful showing current progress rather lifetime history. generic problem semi-structured documents meta-data consistent naming making names word might created_on pdf created etc really frustrating investigated figure field map created tika solrcel map find way go map dynamic glob pattern stored field look pops satisfactory best. call anything solrj call url solrj lots convenience stuff set particular parameters parse response etc it's communicating solr via url look something like solrquery instance nice command setfacetprefix it's entire method really it's really setting solrparams key/value pair equivalent remember it's setpath method use set destination request suggest maybe /suggest it's something like best. worddelimiterfilterfactory probably stripping parens try running terms http//replaced.url i'll see effects various tokenizers filters sure check verbose checkbox it's good place start understanding intention various options particular worddelimiterfilterfactory split intra-word delimiters alpha-numeric characters best. bq make commits reliable unreliable sounds like 're saying 're expect 're talking predicting documents searchable mikhail spot it's real time get fetches recent copy document whether it's searchable limited application 're interested searching newly-added. agree upayavira seems architecturally example crux matter differ field figuring going expensive burdening searches kind logic create custom update processor use component build updates ingest docs build signature field issue delete query update best. version solr/lucene instances index corruption see lucene/changes.txt file might account something stab dark though troubling best. stay master/slave full replication switch probably price i'll pay indexes different safe side solr replicate whole thing really much problem shawn says though much would simpler best. uploaded files right place release harish could please confirm things look good release apache download page time mirrors catch though updated sourceindex files jakarta-site0 well probably time update well checked http//replaced.url well harish update website i'm sure involved try later tonight get. personally i'd strongly recommend point mandating whenever going version solr another example schema config files ship new version used customizations re-merged/re-worked supported work safer work new configs don't know developers solr long since ditched solr certainly don't manually test back compatibility back-compatibility unit tests i'm aware. ok good authority way go. ensuring replacements properly encoded xml. i'll get better response solr don't taking time retrieve large stored field writing response client-side parsing data sure. ok thanks confirming impala table backed parquet it's surprising hear get higher throughput loading parquet table compared phoenix even using parquet file structure used impala quite lightweight compared hfiles example column non-key row phoenix contains full row key column qualifier need sorted writing hfiles trade-off course query single rows extremely quickly hbase whereas don't performant impala using suggestions gave likely able improve performance loading think creating parquet files impala always give substantially higher throughput. thanks keeping date andrew couple considerations okhttp.version property used okhttp driver could run openstack-marconi live tests rackspace-cloudqueues ones marconi uses okhttp driver default able send patch requests make sure version bump breaking anything tried could try upgrading latest thanks. noticed added closing scanners left auto-close gc exactly sure mean point comment. null value comes byonlocationresolver.extractconfig http//replaced.url port missing config bag null gets coerced null transitions call getoptionalval understanding optional value provide default missing exact meaning null whether it's missing property map mapped null make difference opposite interpretation would put nulls maps means byonlocationresolver similar client code must implement null checks
