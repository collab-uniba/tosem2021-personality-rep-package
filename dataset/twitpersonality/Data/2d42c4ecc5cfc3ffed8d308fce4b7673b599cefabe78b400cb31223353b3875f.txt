potentially hundreds similar say crawling amazon buy.com someone search sites website realise better ways example eventually would build search crawl index say someone would site search digital camera would get results indexes hopefully dynamic facets etc etc done fly ask currently developing webscrapers crawl websites dump data db thinking tacking solr server crawl db problem approach crawling worlds ecommerce sites forever seems solr might read multiple indexes etc many thanks. gut feel thing killing beam usual suspect oom see i've noted nothing wrt logs though 0.x works i'll see processes pids advice offer login run sudo 'couchdb -i it's interactive mode maybe something useful left. seen anything prevent. verify solves leaks web containers would say yes proper life cycle persistent

stripped let know still see thanks. short-term think improving logging help debug cases like future good idea lot it's ways actually suggestions long-term prevalent problem throughout client implementation would likely better solved uniform manner. problem around discovered forgotten increase number max maps config killed job changed max maps restarted mapper tablets mappers running
