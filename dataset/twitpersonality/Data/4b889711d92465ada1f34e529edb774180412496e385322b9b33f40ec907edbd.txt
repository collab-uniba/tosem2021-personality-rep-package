hi potential likely extension couchdb contract working need win00 work done would rather even time similar couchdbx rather specialized weeks effort based experience similar thing osx preliminary enquiry see anyone suitably capable available interested order get client approval would need completed march rfn would fine currently deploy couchdb platform-specific ruby gem binary libraries required erlang icu spidermonkey etc binaries nginx packaged individual gems requirements managed using gem dependencies package ruby knows extend command line environment include binary resources path/env vars/libpath etc given command line environment starting couch case couch ruby allows configure multiple instances run/manage ruby binaries package location-independent done munging rakefile builds gem means package application isolated machine environment relative given baseline done osx cool although flaws always terminating process concerned getting running system deployed windows need done windows nginx could either must configurable managed via ruby wrapper must native code compilation required gem install e.g cygwin required would conflict existing cygwin installation use private gem repository reason needs work windows xp vista corresponding server versions simple osx wrapper application provides server coupled merb-based app present purely html interface similar osx finder itunes part contract manages updating gems compaction using xmpp talk presence server etc none contract need gui portion installer done windows xp vista although must require additional downloads e.g .net must use shared ruby install gui manages/starts/stops/log admin app points embedded safari mozilla automatically selected port nothing else fails start app must raise explanatory dialog obviously functions handled admin app must fully this-is-just-a-windows-app e.g box help link pretty trivial clear tradeoffs embedding gecko windows app rather ie concerned tracking ie version different client installs maybe issue part really nothing couch would person parts single contract copyright would vest linkuistics company bsd license credit author linkuistics including admin although gui wrapper may required hence finished stage gauging interest/possibility open suggestions/ quotes/offers/enquiries done non-local subbing would need way verifying competence presuming list reaches couchdb-aware talent. netflix switched site search solr two weeks ago it's great walter could persuade add notes. ok whole dbq thing baffles heck may totally base would committing help least worth ths wouldn't dbq specifically said olddeletes map used dbi problem acording heap dumps looked suspect correct root cause ooms perhaps wouldn't using hard/soft commits effectively enough uncommitted data it's causing oom hard say w/o details confirmation exactly looking claim heap dump thanks replying using solr version even saw bounded 0k count looking heap dump amazed keep 0k entries yes see around 0m entries according heap dump around 00g memory occupied bytesref exactly looking say see 0m entries sure wouldn't confusing keys olddeletes instances bytesref jvm. in-reply-to starting new discussion mailing
