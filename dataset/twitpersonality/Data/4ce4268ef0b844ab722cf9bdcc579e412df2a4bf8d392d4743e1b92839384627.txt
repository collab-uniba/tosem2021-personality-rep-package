read storm-0 http //replaced.url question work hdfs state trident topology ensure record ends written hdfs states none. trident topology processes tuples opaque kafka spout three bolts write different forms processed output form different record parallelism rotation policy applied three outputs results two streams writing small files hdfs 'm thinking setting different parallelism outputs reason different parallelism settings across output bolts. trying understand relationship emitted transferred values spout trident topology multiple instances topology executing expected ratio emitted transferred would least similar instances topology differ quite bit example 0x another unit measured tuple tree storm topologies trident batch. thanks helps answer question batch fails could records batch get written disk hdfs state another
