hi sam android apps created internal hobby projects connect couchdb via replication preload database remote instance documents add local instance replicated back remote instance use basic add authentication hardcoded considering use accountmanager make couchdb listen interfaces mount sdcard edit local.ini would normal pc would rely apps though since expect people installing app. curl http//replaced.url couchdb welcome version congratulations violence last refuge incompetent. possible solution might simple create virtualhost apache0 points particular documentroot file /etc/apache0/sites-available/couchdb.example.com allowoverride none sudo /etc/init.d/apache0 equivalent system /var/www/couchdb.example.com/htdocs/ following content. hi message would like accomplish following use flash access data couchdb requires couchdb serve file called crossdomain.xml flash application load first verify allowed flash requires file located root http server e.g http//replaced.url accomplished using virtualhost url rewrite options couchdb offers described earlier nicolas orr blitz.io neat app describes follows tried works beautifully edit domain.com zone add record blitz.domain.com create blitz.txt file put content blitz told put upload blitz.txt attachment design document get content blitz.txt attachment ok test couchdb hit root couchdb reports version however put rewrite couchdb complains many security issue fair enough 0x thus design doc looks like instead blitz course need figure hostname couchdb database would like access e.g flash.example.org make sure hostname actually resolves machine access i.e runs couchdb edit virtual host part couchdb reflect choice e.g restart couchdb afterwards think even necessary add entry futon use couchapp way like create design document called _design/flash contains crossdomain.xml file attachment rewrite statements much like mentioned curl http//replaced.url provide crossdomain.xml added attachment second rewrite points root database question allowing get documents database http//yourserver:0/flash/doc0 accessible http//replaced.url setup allow flash application connect couchdb without problems hope helps. hi 0cts although seem see nails everywhere couchdb hammer better storing xml xml database like sedna allows versioning documents xpath searches documents sent mobile. hi looking amount replies wrt topic seems much interest full text searching really hard tell would expect feature implemented couchdb way would supersede nice couchdb-lucene combo said _really simple_ probably bad solution performance wise search implementation look couchdb lists decide _view sent _list function within _list function implement full text search inspecting document data setup least allows replication functionality might enough. mng-0 doc define plugins pom mng-0 pattern parameters default values pom need standard usage mng-0 make additions pom backward/forward compatible mng-0 allow maven monitored using jmx mng-0 make build process info read-only mojos provide mechanism explicit out-params mojos declare mng-0 use uniform format tags. welcome board. i've using rc0 since uploaded i've checked zip file working expected earlier. buildcontext looks indeed like good candidate know cross dependencies almost unpredictable would require parse evaluate sources opted recompiling sources yes algorithm make possible problem simply delete files parts might created plugins e.g resource processing. use maven-plugin-testing-harness 0.x maven 0.x maven-plugin-testing-harness 0.x maven 0.x think 0.x 0.x testing harness provide client api maybe able run tests different versions maven certain. changes done css provide us working xdoc plugin m0.0 interested test soon possible. thanks reminder jira back need call vote plugin jason try building snapshot plugin trunk see solves problem i'll go ahead ferry release. except maven rc0 released exactly happened don't process releasing maven bundle specified plugins uses latest bumping version snapshots agree vincent worth first need releasing maven bundled already released plugins. hi run maven deploy phase maven upload nexus final file artifactid version respect set build could indicate maven deploy plugin upload nexus example prefix_ artifactid version anyone know thanks regards. following comment added issue jar test classes code test plugin. hi i'm saturday sunday kind regards. think snapshots different aspect outside version ranges version ranges meant specify range versions snapshots fit perfectly version range problem statement it'snapshots fit perfectly version range missing point technically correct snapshot version precedes version number however point specifying version tag dependency problem allowing snapshots fill version ranges unless specified version range inconsistent behavior non-version ranges work don't use version ranges get precise control snapshots/non-snapshots i.e specify never get snapshot specify 0-snapshot always get snapshot get specified currently use version ranges loose control expect behavior specify expect snapshots specify snapshot hand specify 0,0.0-snapshot would expect 0-snapshot fulfill therequirement quote prevent accidental use snapshots released versionsare available given range. don't available determine used theversion range never include snapshot unless directed theversion range determine resolved version nothing else. quote mechanism place explicitly state dependencies beresolvedto snapshot versions dependencies certainly useful yes would useful. quote 're dealing way nothing withversionranges able say don't snapshots acertainartifact specifying normal version without snapshot going beresolved snapshot unless it's another declaration mention
