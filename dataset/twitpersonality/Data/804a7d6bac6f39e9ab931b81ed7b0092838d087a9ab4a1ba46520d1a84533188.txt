hi sam android apps created internal hobby projects connect couchdb via replication preload database remote instance documents add local instance replicated back remote instance use basic add authentication hardcoded considering use accountmanager make couchdb listen interfaces mount sdcard edit local.ini would normal pc would rely apps though since expect people installing app. curl http //replaced.url couchdb welcome version congratulations violence last refuge incompetent. possible solution might simple create virtualhost apache0 points particular documentroot file /etc/apache0/sites-available/couchdb.example.com allowoverride none sudo /etc/init.d/apache0 equivalent system /var/www/couchdb.example.com/htdocs/ following content. hi edward message would like accomplish following use flash access data couchdb requires couchdb serve file called 'crossdomain.xml flash application load first verify allowed flash requires file located root http server e.g http //replaced.url accomplished using virtualhost url rewrite options couchdb offers described earlier nicolas orr blitz.io neat app describes follows tried works beautifully edit domain.com zone add record blitz.domain.com create blitz.txt file put content blitz told put upload blitz.txt attachment design document get content blitz.txt attachment ok test couchdb hit root couchdb reports version however put rewrite couchdb complains many security issue fair enough 0x thus design doc looks like instead blitz course need figure hostname couchdb database would like access e.g flash.example.org make sure hostname actually resolves machine access i.e runs couchdb edit virtual host part couchdb reflect choice e.g restart couchdb afterwards think even necessary add entry futon use couchapp way like create design document called _design/flash contains crossdomain.xml file attachment rewrite statements much like mentioned curl 'http //replaced.url provide crossdomain.xml added attachment second rewrite points root database question allowing get documents database http //yourserver:0/flash/doc0 accessible http //replaced.url setup allow flash application connect couchdb without problems hope helps. hi 0cts although seem see nails everywhere couchdb hammer better storing xml xml database like sedna allows versioning documents xpath searches documents sent mobile. hi looking amount replies wrt topic seems much interest full text searching really hard tell would expect feature implemented couchdb way would supersede nice couchdb-lucene combo said _really simple_ probably bad solution performance wise search implementation look couchdb lists decide _view sent _list function within _list function implement full text search inspecting document data setup least allows replication functionality might enough
