set apache reverse proxy couchdb problems replicating idea setup apache later handle authentication however even disabled get following failure trying replicate apache runs port forwarding couchdb error get error part database actual document occurs seems vary unable reproduce behaviour smaller database well mb already tried dumping reloading database contents nothing changed proxy configuration follows hope fairly standard proxyrequests allowencodedslashes normal requests couchdb futon interface seem working fine proxy ideas problem could thanks. always minutes. hi devs possible push fluido skin work happens completed fixes time ago would like another bootstrap 0.x based released modification work bootstrap 0.x begins lot stuff time. quick search central shall even apache project adhere convention receive. vote please period already due. dependency different poms dependency think like inject annotation guice thank. parse.vm lives next template.vm call parse parse.vm macro available rest though tried probably create custom skin really create. course piss lot people would course several reasons people not popularity old collisions etc even enforce happen maven added plugin dev center. done r0000000. probably query resolution unresolved. vote please. hi paul looks way better thing though alread fixed issue bound distinct maven version change e.g. mng-0. hi folks herve quite busy right preparing doxia sitetools along maven site plugin several tickets would like fix changes impact skins provide need adapted close look skins updated years active improvements happen fluido skin given fact probably work none changed html0 would like retire skins keep two active would ultimately mean two updated later proposal please share opinion agree start vote retire. hi previously suggested makes sense retire skins updated long time resources maintain properly last releases therefore propose retire skins vote successful make final release skin making clear skin site retired source code moved retired area subversion repository process retiring skin described though plugins process universal vote open hours yes time would ask kindly already cast vote revote make. following services unavailable upgrade. unreachable two different carriers. fact mentioned front page skin addtionally maven. read mind idea weeks option work strongly support remove build files ant maven maven along maven ant tasks need removed need free use aether ant tasks. terms contributions zero someone keen enough code prepare patch simply lazy need fork clone push create pull request even work see benefit. mshared-0. problem intimately connected solr batch job hadoop distributed real-time query scheme hate add yet another complex framework solr rp job simply problem transform solr query subset query shard let solrcloud mechanism well aware 'zoo alternatives evaluating don't get solr. particular case came solr.py http//replaced.url way going become official solr python client would nice someone knows unicode/python go fix someone wants point place lists invalid xml characters probably figure. thanks steve smoking gun tested see issue don't upgrade yet however found setting mm=0 sorts case giving following still testing however looks positive far thing still noticed single word synonyms output synonym within debug query multi-word even issue honest sure means something noticed difference parsed query thanks help thought going mad. hi he gave excellent explanation lucene might know ability plug codec full control postings stored format used files written field within segment codec ie field foo standard field bar uses pulsing instance case since pulsing wrapper around standard codec codecs try write set files segment reason introduced codec segment really ordinal build set codecs used segment ordinal used build filenames case codec suppose standard codec ord ordinal used files codec writes files without ordinal nrm fdt fdx fnrm written indexwriter directly functionality behind might exposed via codec sooner later afterall lucene functionality system fine right thing feature codecs introduced aka trunk thanks simon. hi working solr web interfact calling well sized index don't remember changing anything significantly past hours query like returning documents query specific text return documents relevant query although issue affect application got curious happening suggestions anyone. could create option would allow turning updatelog update request useful would something could specified dataimporthandler request way could full import log performance solrj maintains index logging would enabled thanks. i'm trying prevent search going across multiple values multivalued field running issue i've read standard way positionincrementgap larger ps value however don't make phrase query another field searched specific i'm indexing collection music albums multiple tracks album artist searches contain artist track don't make single phrase query indexed across two separate fields small ps large posincgap don't anything way get past view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing list archive nabble.com. don't said version solr 're using asking replication built-in see http//replaced.url slave don't block update happening automatically switches updated index upon older versions solr used rsynch etc best. solr admin exposes time last commit use http//replaced.url. instance solr don't start since added replication startup using solr see index contains 000k documents total 000mb removing replicate startup instance starts without error found needed replicate startup version information master restarting instance something special needs done using replicate startup bug solr portion stacktrace thanks. wiener comparator applying current schema byte value read disk schema read describes value components it's trying apply current schema cast bytes comparison something must gone wrong deleted part statement store schema data problem changing schema incompatible way existing data nodetool scrub probably best bet i've checked handles specific problem general drop rows sstables read problem best thing snapshot copy data node qa box run tests hope helps. little topic remember reading facebook web user give focus inbox search box sent message back warm appropriate caches think may original paper interest way warm key cache say sending get_range_slices command asks columns don't particular need wondering. current issues delete know safe upgrade things check read column back cli timestamp expected proven otherwise assume it's client side thing add logging app turn debug logging cassandra notice fault stop running task try produce cli works cl small possibility could connect node get delete warn messages dropped messages still troubles provide info delete performed.a. general symptom mvn clean compile don't always work mvn clean package dependencies accumulo sub-projects require jars exist rather compiled classes root cause seems current configuration maven-dependency-plugin copy-dependencies execution get better move wikisearch outside trunk however suspect could generally solve problem reconfiguring copy-dependencies execution differently anybody know properly. another way say cross-data center replication accumulo left layer top accumulo application space cassandra supports mode bigger write replication write quorum allowing writes eventually propagate reads happen stale versions data increases availability cost consistency important dealing links less reliable higher latency nothing special lower consistency application space might slightly less. hi reading email twice skimming w0c stuff planning wiki page strong advocate getting done first don't even need w0c data structures agree range api complex imagined implementations seem differ across extending hacky code robustify selection looked project possible alternative whether w0c whatever data model standard correctly implemented relevance right web app written definitely adhere first big milestone happy contribute package uses reactjs highlight stuff demo available replace dns dare expose http//replaced.url try annotator selecting text please tell something interested best
