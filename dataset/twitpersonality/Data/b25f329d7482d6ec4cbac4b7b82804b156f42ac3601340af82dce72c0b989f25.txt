omri need indicate solr at_location field accept multiple values add field declaration see reference information options. makes next i.e still answered question next previous really means already know next page another query get next record. hi henri make sure container running solr set utf-0 example tomcat server.xml file connector definitions include join conversation like us facebook follow us twitter. oops sorry hijacking thread put real subject place. need include unique field fl parameter needed anyways match highlight fragments result docs highlighting working join conversation may even get ipad nook like us facebook follow us twitter. hi anyone ever set things figured good way access solr filter chain java code specifically would like tokenize data search strings possibly even facet values way solr filter chains additional pre-search processing e.g tokenizing way produce better fuzzy search query post-search processing find matches within facet values thanks advance. well sort depends mean previous next record sequencing built concept solr lucene indexes sequential isi.e use case data available support use case. hi mark used dih shall need leave comments set others done another question initial index create delta run commit run optimize without optimize deleted records still show query results. actual query look hl.snippets parameter join conversation may even get ipad nook like us facebook follow us twitter. could add standard field shard populate distinct value shard facet field look facet counts value corresponds shard hey-presto done. hi michael well stock answer it depends example would able search filename without searching file contents would always search together copy file parsed file content pdf single search field set default search field kind processing normalizing data case insensitive accent insensitive word contains camel case e.g theveryidea split case changes watch things like ipad word contains numbers left together separated stemming searching stemming would find stem stemmed sort thing always english languages involved text processing indexing vs searching able find hits based first characters term ngrams able highlight text segments search terms found probably read various tokenizers filters available prototyping see looks basically one fits part power solr lucene configurability achieve results business case calls part drawback solr lucene especially new folks configurability achieve results business case calls anyone got anything else suggest michael. hi nizan realize replying thread email client would get back isinfo thread since replication replicate top-level solr.xml file defines available cores dynamic cores requirement custom code wasted. hi sorry duplication seems like sent yesterday never made troubles solr spellcheck response running version overview search something really ugly like get back response suggestions list rck suggestions list two words book fine spelled correctly i.e got hits word suggestions ugly thing though hits problem handling result tell difference suggestions correctly spelled term suggestions something odd like happening searches obviously garbage i.e words real words show index suggestions illustrate point setup running multiple shards may part issue example book might found shards another think anything schema since really search suggestions returned us bits pieces would really like see response coming back indication word found suggestions hacked around code little bit wondering anyone across approaches taken created new classes extend indexbasedspellchecker spellcheckcomponent follows package imports excluded sort brevity methods taken overridden classes changes noted sd comments modification allows correctly spelled words returned suggestion modification working tandem sirsidynixspellcheckcomponent allows words suggestions returned spell check component even sharded search changes marked sd comments modification designed may work tandem sirsidynixindexbasedspellchecker return mispelled words suggestions flipped false suggestions index true thesuggestions null //sd removed thesuggestions.size shardrequest allow misspelled words suggestions thesuggestions.size always true hence removal continue //if shardrequest word mispelled add list mispelled words else extendedresults suggestions.size word misspelled added suggestions freqinfo isxml getting back search applying modified code thanks. looks like specified value pdfy reflected results query query searching vpn hence matches query yield. using unique solr index sounds like may value solr index unique bears resemblance unique derived data another way put makes two records solr index the unique istwo entries solr index isrelated original data unique immutable i.e update row database unique derived row would update otherwise nothing solr recognize duplicate entry delete insert instead insert. oops sorry missed well multivalued setting explicitly allow multiple values actual use case i.e multiple values field multivalued problem trying solve. without speaking directly indexing searching specific fields certainly possible retrieve xml file solr db allow binary field associated index document store gzipped xml file binary field retrieve certain conditions get original document information found solr handle much faster db regularly index large portion documents xml files prone frequent changes keep blob solr index make sure retrieve field really xml files relatively static i.e change rarely new ones still might make sense use real db store keep primary key db row solr index join conversation like us facebook follow us twitter. reading wrote originally wrote think misunderstanding based architecture code code server level solrj indexing calls meant server solr instance mean client thinking without thinking server sorry hopefully someone else chime specific view message context http//replaced.url sent solr user mailing list archive nabble.com. suppose something silly like fact indexing chain includes words= stopwords.txt query chain register february get time viewing three course circulation basics self-paced training suite. hi downloaded file unzipped see inside file tried unzipping errors look inside file see java code example ended unzipped .java extension example path apache-solr-0.0\lucene\backwards\src\test\org\apache\lucene\analysis\tokenattributes see two files ideas specific tool using expand windows xp thanks join conversation may even get ipad nook cid replaced email.addr.es like us facebook cid replaced email.addr.es follow us twitter. use replication call inexperience really early working fully understanding solr best way approach various issues mention prototype non-production code covered though look replication feature thanks. possibility consider really need documents specifically empty non-defined values oxymoron control values send indexing could set special value means no value done similar vein using something like empty given field meaning original document actually value field i.e something unlikely real value easily select documents querying field empty instead negated form select however considered things like index relatively rare us value gut feel impacting indexes much size-wise performance-wise. thing think post-process snippets i.e pull highlighting tags strings look match result description field looking match find replace description original highlight text i.e highlight tags still place join
