looks overengineered types zips jar either. think looking maven embedder. horribly afraid right documentation says b defined b 's parent 's dependency management section since dependency management selected referenced 's pom b compile scope thanks. aware change intentional conforms poms procedure described docs nothing nothing less. hi release preps constantly failing build maven mvn -preporting site help simply means actually tried read jar file skin received classes directory target traced proceed debugging debug symbols match source code anyone clue system tries resolve instead local repository highly assume sonatype eclipse aether issue insights welcome. already. hi folks anyone already noticed plugin http //replaced.url might automate test pr jason wants thoughts. convention way omit last zero done maven plugins/components. thank offer best time go channel. ok thank process sites later day. canceling vote due problems pom files herve found shall respin vote today. hi folks would like patch several issues jira unfortunately right change tickets e.g target version component forth anyone able promote thanks. cause problem dependency transitive dpmgt section read/compared mdep would least expect warning anyone else. noticed work therefore asking last 0.x release branch intended able cut release permissions promoting release thanks. hi still couple issues left jira note release depends release skins parent. updated good possible. think special idea mind could read snippet retrieve bytes specific encoding compare guessing encoding tricky would require icu0j course user supplies wrong encoding lost. done http //replaced.url completely disassembled tarball build maven theirselves non-canoncial build likely going support modifications known us rather untar offical tarball rebuilt package though grab tarball internet somehow. hi folks recently proposed mskins-0 downgrade 0.x two reasons updated site.vm custom.css bootstrap yet knows real changes model change must happen patch version received feedback neither positive negative would like perform downgrade site rendering work expected additionally made several improvements css rendering stuff locally parent project would like merge back plugin bring site plugins let us postpone bootstrap 0.x fluido skin 0.x. able restage tomorrow working patch doxia-0 would like commit. model would require maven cleanup env like m0_home .m0 m0.conf forth otherwise break current limitations without. hi barrie docs definitively correspond poms moment chapter 'staging latest documentation says release prepared simply wrong release prepared performed documentation staged due missing next problem made push pom back forth simply work scm publish bound parent site-deploy phase site stage-deploy goal scm-publish publish-scm works know whether correct verification kinda awkward says wait sync linked site say anything sync given timeframe sync occurs path '/www/maven.apache.org/pom exist '/www/maven.apache.org/content/pom moreover directory skins updated skins-0 directory exists pom-archives skipped steps stuck lost help would greatly appreciated. hi devs promote staged repos skins parent fluido skin gone happened auto-dropper active rao source releases already promoted herve thanks. hi robert back october result retirement vote positive plugin still without notice issues still open jira repo github simply. currently running patched version maven offensive commit reverted surefire master freebsd 0-stable shall see wether cause hour. thanks fix added purpose resembles output site tool generates modules menu looks awkward outputs uniform. file jira ticket. hi brett thanks promotion seems like edit tickets old created ages ago able drop completely thanks. file issue. quite annoying took quite time figure correct settings git cmd egit even know whether got right subversion made way easier stackoverflow good help place anyone better cross-os setting. yes resposibility always good simply make build fail instead log collision happens. assumption yes. located lifecycle phase 'maven-plugin. though minor doc issues related msite-0 downgrade advise velocity noted caution guarantee velocity request tools properly work additionally filtering section updated context variable makes easy display dotted maven properties. hi herve seems like entire process requires another sign fortunately already jira account xircles account wrote codehaus support asked transferring account intend recreate jira account created many tickets current thanks. hi tibor currently running full test bed various maven versions surefire master pass log files along target directory shall join channel. pages missing apt files remains empty 'maven actually fixed. hi still couple issues left jira. hi folks performed another cleanup jira last couple days old issues right open issues manageble point view noticed several plugins touched years status following plugins anyone working planning release version thoughts objections would like retire clean jira plugin plugin. already known issue year http //replaced.url. guys agreed reuse tags apply procedure tomcat team staged build fit abandoned tag remains relased added change log http //replaced.url see version opinion release notes shall mention skipped skipped. first thing came mind. nobody retiring fluido skin subject. indeed mngeclipse jetty gone years codehaus support assitance thank much. always minutes. hi devs possible push fluido skin work happens completed fixes time ago would like another bootstrap 0.x based released modification work bootstrap 0.x begins lot stuff time. quick search central shall even apache project adhere convention receive. vote please period already due. dependency different poms dependency think like inject annotation guice thank. parse.vm lives next template.vm call parse 'parse.vm macro available rest though tried probably create custom skin really create. course piss lot people would course several reasons people n't popularity old collisions etc even enforce happen maven added plugin dev center. done r0000000. probably query resolution unresolved. vote please. hi paul looks way better thing though alread fixed issue bound distinct maven version change e.g. mng-0. hi folks herve quite busy right preparing doxia sitetools along maven site plugin several tickets would like fix changes impact skins provide need adapted close look skins updated years active improvements happen fluido skin given fact probably work none changed html0 would like retire skins keep two active would ultimately mean two updated later proposal please share opinion agree start vote retire. hi previously suggested makes sense retire skins updated long time resources maintain properly last releases therefore propose retire skins vote successful make final release skin making clear skin site retired source code moved retired area subversion repository process retiring skin described though plugins process universal vote open hours yes time would ask kindly already cast vote revote make. following services unavailable upgrade. unreachable two different carriers. fact mentioned front page skin addtionally maven. read mind idea weeks option work strongly support remove build files ant maven maven along maven ant tasks need removed need free use aether ant tasks. terms contributions zero someone keen enough code prepare patch simply lazy need fork clone push create pull request even work see benefit. mshared-0. simply list dependencies report. hi folks actually proceed third-party plugins comply naming pattern given plugin created document beeen first published simply add disclaimer legacy reasons plugins central created date. question obviously. infact added introduce maven.conf m0.conf mng-0 make conf modification /etc /usr/local/etc snap. yes shame simply forgot agenda already ok. think credit goes github eases participation non-committers tremendously though need improve pr process mirrored repos. considered running versions display-plugin-updates. open issue infra inquire default pr procedure look like mirrored repos github think need common approach entire asf. would like fluido reference parent released yet ok actually moreover found another bug fluido would like report fix. think variations depenencies must go either classifiers build qualiafiers start allow arbitrary elements people start ask custom elements x. therefore custom elements allow plugin 's. working sample project attached already please check. thank much bringing personally disgusted stupid names proposed like boom shotgun anything else related rifle arming. proverb n't make think rm mono-module multi-module project he/she needs know perform steps fine relase docs scattered several pages references would like avoid another exception. might added http //replaced.url. http //replaced.url. thanks turns something wrong repo r.a.o able browse yesterday try browse nexus ui get http repos broken file issue infra. opened issues least fixed. thanks guys look http //replaced.url next couple days process required. thanks change poms accordingly. forgot always use relative path docs otherwise could misinterpreted. aware retirement plan procedure go anyawy post list first figure plugins really dead sorry part. opposing previous proposals really see urgent need animal link look meaning maven clearly see refers well-educated human think needs evaluated though know represent graphic. note maven-0 repo probably typo. think fully correct leave goals defaults distributionmanagement/site element perform site-deploy default check m-relase-p docs say. ultimately mean plugins run maven someone still uses older version java build projects. big question would like clarify first commons compress gone java minor release people requesting. head idea mind several months make clean cut read period new issues asf jira someone found issue already codehaus jira migrated course. hi folks would like another bug squash like last year currently unresolved bugs updated three years hardly believe updated ever maybe resolved new versions automatically please look whether see still anything else object go ahead close fix let know week. avail still error leave profile reporting. done. fine would like note first announce publically users mailing list think deserves major bump plugin version wdyt. hi changes since last release. would favor move java make strong use nio0 file operations lot pain go away. could announce least five days advance would give least timeframe merge prs handle issues. think must tandem packaging zip finally. yes works stupid fault simply noticed use secured url used read-only url sorry noise. yes maven mvn -prun-its install build.log files say updated msite mpir projects touched subversion. would drop altogether go. hi paul good idea done already pre-0.0 versions going think strictly follow no-fix-version-for-incomplete/invalid/wontfix able assign real versions great. hi michael staged site http //replaced.url. rather add plain text release notes html junk unreadible. n't course solve problem pre-existing files give clean way things right new files. given companies/folks react something discontinued would move java baseline christman first release java e.g. policy make apps run java months even compatible n't concern. help becuase repos located github apache. non-binding. cloned tested upgrade msite pain go away parse/ include. possible ran uts twice check dep tree mediated. thanks announcement actively providing several years finally able contribute officially directly thank. confirm tried wagon 0-snapshot maven master. glad found documentation hard would like repeat information serveral places need update maybe interpolation issue please open jira issue thanks. hi vote passed following result promote artifacts central repo pmcs please promote source release zip file add release. hi folks in-house project jcl-over-slf0j nothing special far module dependends net.sf.michael-o.dirctxsrc dircontextsource jar:0 compile slf0j-simple test scope mvn dependency tree properly gives master gives questions another fix master relied erratic behavior core previously depmgmthave influence transitive deps direct really say right wrong two slf0j bindings slf0j simple logback obviously wrong thoughts. please reply promotion http //replaced.url would like manage release like codehaus jira thanks. insane works thank much need fix fail w/ maven 0.x due aether advise must raise mpir msite mksins-0 work anymore may others. yes http //replaced.url obstained merge patch version minds course. hi folks seems like full access maven directory see anyone able check error correct permissions username michaelo thanks
