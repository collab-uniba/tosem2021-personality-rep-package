open issue related matters seem received much attention regards. simply list dependencies report. hi folks actually proceed third-party plugins comply naming pattern given plugin created document beeen first published simply add disclaimer legacy reasons plugins central created date. question obviously. infact added introduce maven.conf m0.conf mng-0 make conf modification /etc /usr/local/etc snap. yes shame simply forgot agenda already ok. think credit goes github eases participation non-committers tremendously though need improve pr process mirrored repos. considered running versions display-plugin-updates. open issue infra inquire default pr procedure look like mirrored repos github think need common approach entire asf. would like fluido reference parent released yet ok actually moreover found another bug fluido would like report fix. think variations depenencies must go either classifiers build qualiafiers start allow arbitrary elements people start ask custom elements x. therefore custom elements allow plugin s. working sample project attached already please check. thank much bringing personally disgusted stupid names proposed like boom shotgun anything else related rifle arming. proverb not make think rm mono-module multi-module project he/she needs know perform steps fine relase docs scattered several pages references would like avoid another exception. might added http//replaced.url. thanks turns something wrong repo r.a.o able browse yesterday try browse nexus ui get http repos broken file issue infra. opened issues least fixed. thanks guys look http//replaced.url next couple days process required. thanks change poms accordingly. forgot always use relative path docs otherwise could misinterpreted. aware retirement plan procedure go anyawy post list first figure plugins really dead sorry part. opposing previous proposals really see urgent need animal link look meaning maven clearly see refers well-educated human think needs evaluated though know represent graphic. note maven-0 repo probably typo. think fully correct leave goals defaults distributionmanagement/site element perform site-deploy default check m-relase-p docs say. ultimately mean plugins run maven someone still uses older version java build projects. big question would like clarify first commons compress gone java minor release people requesting. head idea mind several months make clean cut read period new issues asf jira someone found issue already codehaus jira migrated course. hi folks would like another bug squash like last year currently unresolved bugs updated three years hardly believe updated ever maybe resolved new versions automatically please look whether see still anything else object go ahead close fix let know week. avail still error leave profile reporting. see changes fetching changes remote git repository fetching upstream changes http//replaced.url honour jvm settings build new jvm forked please consider using daemon http//replaced.url downloadwrapper up-to-date honour jvm settings build new jvm forked please consider using daemon http//replaced.url went wrong run stacktrace option get stack trace run info debug option get log output. hi got yes case fall back corner case handling failed replicas recreated another available log directory later failed log directory fixed existing data broker startup detect duplicate replicas fail starting let admin fix issue manually optimal sure common case though overall wondering need storing created flag replica seems useful uncommon case common case log directory fails broker running tradeoff don't optimize uncommon case need write failed replicas instead successfully created replica zk former lot less latter thanks. attempt fix kafka-0 appears problem broker closed connection passively client react appropriately networkreceive.readfrom rather throw eofexception means stream reached unexpectedly instead return negative bytes read signifying acceptable stream selector channel passively closed don't try read data don't try write close key believe fix problem merge pull request git repository running alternatively review apply changes patch close pull request make commit master/trunk branch least following commit message. done. it's good idea past major new features tend create wiki page outline design wiki pages organized better looking thanks.

experience enabling tls clusters helpful comment far know openssl reduce tls overhead still lose zero-copy optimisation attempts making possible retain zero-copy tls kernel probably early us consider kafka http//replaced.url. super useful thanks jason. i've fixed function slightly predicate needless ported verifiableproperties it's really try arround already utility function utils.parsecsvmap str doubt worth moving simple try-catch separate function hope resolves. hi see error logs running zookeeper server don't action error shutdown server state changes org.apache.zookeeper.server.zookeeperserver:0 zookeeper server don't action error shutdown server state changes org.apache.zookeeper.server.zookeeperserver:0 make sense fix providing shutdownhandler best wishes. hey manikumar clientid don't unique clients clientid share quota quota management merged trunk enabled given company kafka clients company explicitly specify clientid. hmm correlation application level information kafka request maintained o.a.k.c.networkclient associated tcp sessions even tcp session disconnects reconnects correlation reset still monotonically increasing maybe make clear suggesting anything relying tcp transport layer everything handled application layer clients perspective timeout defined tcp timeout defined upper bound time wait receiving response client receive response timeout reached retry suggestion long fetchrequest needs retried matter reason use full fetchrequest depend networkclient implementations i.e regardless whether retry existing tcp connection new question trying answer essentially let leader followers agree messages log comparing following two solutions use something like tcp ack epoch request/response level piggy back leader knowledge partition level follower personally think better direct leader maintains state leos followers day leader wants make sure states correct directly confirms states followers instead inferring epoch note subtle maybe important difference use case epoch tcp seq difference tcp ack confirms packets lower seq received case high epoch request mean data previous response successful kip statement leader receives fetch request epoch knows data sent back fetch request epoch successfully processed follower could tricky expensive make right cases sure considered thinking comparison following two potential issues came thinking case consumer consumer.seek consumer.pause called consumer essentially updated interested set topics positions needs full fetchrequest update position leader thus create new session users call seek /pause often broker could run fetch corrupted messages fetch response corrupt message follower back try fetch back period follower fetching partition corrupt message back partition added back current design seems follower need keep creating new two cases might still useful let session unique client instance like producer idempotent produce allow client update leader side thanks. hi thank kip become really useful thing scanned discussion far wanted start thread make decision keeping cache connection session sort uuid indexed sorry settled already missed case could anyone point discussion rather see protocol client hinting broker going use feature instead client realizing broker offered feature regardless protocol version indicate feature would usable seems work better connection/session attached metadata map could allow would make client-side code easier would don't thank kip clarified already please drop hint could read best jan. yeah seems reasonable well even places add info seem like really useful ones enum generating lowercase came kip-0 first expose info technically enough require change change still simpler/easier multiple calls might reference kip reference call specifically enum already lowercase always compatibility consumers api probably make assumptions capitalization. hi new open source contribution get started apache kafka anyone help find bugs work mentor ask help thanks advance regards
